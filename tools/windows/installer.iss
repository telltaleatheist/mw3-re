; The Windows installer for players (docs/windows.md, Packaging): Inno Setup
; (jrsoftware.org, free), built by tools\windows\package.cmd from the
; package folder it has just made:
;   iscc /DAppVersion=<git describe> /DDist=<the package folder> /O<out dir> tools\windows\installer.iss
; It installs to Program Files\MechWarrior 3 Rebuild with a Start-menu
; shortcut (a desktop one ticked by default) and an uninstaller. The game
; writes nothing there: the player's settings, saves, imported movies, music
; and a disc install live in %APPDATA%\MicroProse\MechWarrior 3, which the
; uninstaller leaves alone. No file of the original game is in the installer.
