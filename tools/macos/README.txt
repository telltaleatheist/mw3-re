MechWarrior 3 Rebuild for macOS
===============================

A fan rebuild of MechWarrior 3's program: the original game's logic, rewritten
to run natively on today's computers. A personal learning project: free, not
sold, and not affiliated with or endorsed by MicroProse, Microsoft or anyone
who holds the MechWarrior name.

It contains no part of the game: you need your own MechWarrior 3, on its disc
or as a disc image (.iso, or .cue with its .bin files), or an installed copy
from a Windows PC.

Installing
----------
It runs on macOS 12 (Monterey) or later, on Apple silicon and Intel Macs.
Drag "MechWarrior 3 Rebuild" into Applications and start it.

The first time, macOS says it cannot check the app for malicious software
(it is a free fan project, not registered with Apple). Open it once this way:
right-click (or Control-click) the app, choose Open, then Open again. Or, after
macOS has blocked it once: System Settings > Privacy & Security, and click
"Open Anyway" beside its name. After that it starts normally.

On the first start it sets up the game from your disc or image (or asks for
your installed copy), and remembers it.

Your settings and saves
-----------------------
In ~/Library/Application Support/MicroProse/MechWarrior 3/ (in Finder: Go >
Go to Folder). It holds mw3.cfg, your pilots and saves, the settings, the
installed game, its music and mw3.log (what the game reported while it ran;
send it with a bug report). Deleting the app keeps this folder.

Licences
--------
The libraries this app uses and their licences: THIRD-PARTY.txt inside the
app (Contents/Resources), with their licence files in Contents/Resources/licenses.
