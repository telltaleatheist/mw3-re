"""What Pirate's Moon's Direct3D strip conversion (0x00570b70, left out of
the port: docs/pm-map.md, the models' form) does to the shipped world models.

    .venv/bin/python -P tests/differential/test_pm_strips.py

Each world's models are read in PM's exe (0x00558ba0) with the conversion
stubbed, as test_pm_gamez.py does; then PM's own 0x00570b70 runs, as the
reader would have called it under Direct3D (model, 0x7fffffff, 0x7fffffff),
on every model it was given that has polygons. Each model is dumped before
and after (header, vertices, normals, lights, every polygon's flags,
indices, materials, UVs and colours, the material refs): the port keeps the
file's form, so it holds only while the conversion changes nothing the
renderer or the game reads. A model it changes is listed with what changed.
It strips only a model of type 0 (+0x00) with polygons; every shipped model
without 0x80 is a facade (type 1), so it returns at once. A type-0 one
reaching it fails the test (its strip path also loads the textures' images,
0x005329e0, which this bench has not set up).
