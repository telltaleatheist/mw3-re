// reader, every file group merged into one folder as unshield does, and its
// VIDEO\ copied beside it. The source may be a CD drive or any folder, an
// ISO 9660 image (2048-byte sectors or raw 2352-byte ones), or a cue sheet
// (Redump's MODE1/2352 .cue/.bin), whose AUDIO tracks become the music.
