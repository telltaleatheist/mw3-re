// macOS. The keyboard's events arrive as SDL scancodes (USB usages) and are
// given back as the DIK codes (the PC keyboard's set-1 scan codes) the game's
// key tables use, one key to one key; the mouse's motion is summed into
// DIMOUSESTATE's relative counts, the first joystick read into a DIJOYSTATE2
// with DirectInput's default 0..65535 axis range.
