# How the rebuild is organised: MW3, Pirate's Moon and the launcher

Decided with Owen, 2026-10-31. (The original exe's own structure is
`architecture.md`; this page is about the rebuild.)

**Replaced for Pirate's Moon (Owen, 2026-11-04): PM lives on the branch `pm`, which never merges to `main`.** It is
a complete copy of the game with PM's changes in place, as the original's `branchep1`. `src/mech3` and `src/gamez`
on `pm` are PM's copies, changed directly; MW3 on `main` stays as shipped plus bug fixes. Fixes cross by git: MW3's merge
from `main` into `pm`; a bug found on `pm` that MW3 also has goes on `main` as its own small commit, cherry-picked or
redone. Packages build `mw3` and the launcher from a tag on `main`, `mw3pm` from a tag on `pm`. On `pm`, MW3's target and
tests no longer matter. What follows about `src/pm/` and the game table describes how `pm` got here: what exists keeps
working, new PM work edits the base files in place or forks where that is plainly easier, and old forks fold in
only when that code is being worked on anyway.

The plain build on `pm` is PM alone: `mw3pm`, `mw3pmtests`, `mw3pmsdltests` (the render's window tests; `MW3_TEST=sdl_render`,
the ones that start MW3's programs do not apply) and `pmprobe`. `-DMW3_BUILD_MW3=ON` brings MW3's programs, probe and tests
back, for reading only. `mw3pm` goes to `--fly` when given it, else to the game (`mw3_main.cpp`, on PM's table). No launcher
in PM's package for now; the combined package is Owen's later decision. The package scripts make PM alone, with its own
Mac bundle id (`com.owenmorgan.mw3pmrebuild`), Windows AppId and write folder (`MicroProse/Pirate's Moon`).

## Three programs, one package

- **The launcher** (ours, not original code): the main icon. It finds the
  installs, runs SETUP (install from disc, the music, the movies) and
  starts the game the player picks. It is its own program, so either game
  can also be started without it.
- **`mw3`**: MechWarrior 3. Started directly, it goes straight into the
  game.
- **`mw3pm`**: Pirate's Moon (after MW3 `v1.0`). Started directly, it goes
  straight into PM.

A release has one download per platform (the Windows installer, the Mac
DMG, the Linux AppImage) holding all three. The installer's main shortcut
is the launcher; the two games get their own Start-menu shortcuts. Each
game runs without the other: removing `mw3pm` leaves MW3 working and the
other way round. Each game mounts its own install's data (the player's
own MW3 or PM files) and keeps its own settings and saves.

## The code

| Folder | What | Address comments |
|---|---|---|
| `src/gamez/` | the shared GameZ engine (render, zTwoD, zSound, readers, ...) | `// Mech3.exe 1.2 @ 0x...` |
| `src/mech3/` | MechWarrior 3's game code | `// Mech3.exe 1.2 @ 0x...` |
| `src/pm/` | only what Pirate's Moon adds or changes | `// Pirate's Moon 1.0 @ 0x...` |
| `src/frontend/sdl/` | the SDL3 platform layer and the launcher | ours |

- MW3's code never includes anything from `src/pm/`.
- Where PM changed a function MW3 also has, PM's version lives in
  `src/pm/` under the same name, with a one-line note on what changed
  (`docs/pm-map.md` lists every pair). An engine function PM changed is
  chosen per game at run time through that game's table, never by `#ifdef`
  scattered in shared code.
- Build targets: `mw3`, `mw3pm`, the launcher, and each game's tests. A
  switch (`-DMW3_BUILD_PM=OFF`) builds MW3 alone.
- Tests: each game has its own test executables and differential tests
  (`MW3_EXE=pm` runs a test against PM's exe), so a PM change cannot break
  MW3's suite unseen.

## Shared types, forked logic

Shared types by field, fork only logic (the lead, 2026-11-02). The same
1999 source means shared code in ours. A struct that grew between the games
is a binary artefact, not a reason to fork: pmdiff's "compiler only, other
offsets" functions (1,102) are MW3's source compiled over larger structs,
and the port names its fields (offsets only in comments), so those
functions run unchanged on PM. So:

- One type per engine struct (zcls::Node, World, Light, Lod and the rest),
  holding the union of both games' fields by name; a field only one game
  has is commented "PM only, +0x..". A file's layout (PM's 16-bit counts)
  is the reader's business, not the struct's.
- Readers are per game: PM's fill the shared types from PM's files.
- A function is forked only where PM's logic changed, through the game
  table (zgame::Table), as the archive and the text reader are.
- Shared code that reads a struct by raw offset (`get<T>(0x..)`,
  `raw[0x..]`) couples it to one game's layout; those reads become named
  fields, module by module, with MW3's tests as the guard. The count on
  2026-11-02: 515 get/put sites on Node, World, Light and Lod, 78 direct
  `raw[]` reads, 163 uses of the int32 count accessors, mostly in zClass.

The route for PM's world files (the lead, 2026-11-02): PM's readers
translate the file into the shared types as they are, in MW3's layout:
the counts as MW3's int32 (+0x54, +0x5c), the box centre and diagonal at
+0x64/+0x70, World's rows, lights and sounds where MW3 keeps them. PM's
extra fields are real C++ members outside the raw block (`Node::pm_virtual`,
`pm_box`, `pm_model`; `World::pm_area2`, `Light::pm_colors`, `Lod::pm_tail`,
`Partition::pm_tail` and `pm_y`), so MW3's raw readers never meet them.
PM's ported functions use the shared accessors, never PM's raw offsets,
with a one-line comment where the offset differs. A node's model is
`model` (MW3's) or `pm_model` (PM's; `model` stays null): the shared code
reading `model` (73 places: gamez/zeffect/zeff_anim_events.cpp 11, gamez/zclass/cls_di.cpp 8, gamez/zeffect/zeff_anim_save.cpp 7, gamez/zclass/cls_node.cpp 7, gamez/zclass/camera.cpp 6, gamez/zinterp/zinterp.cpp 5, gamez/zgeometry/zgeo_model.cpp 5, mech3/zainet_inout.cpp 3, gamez/zclass/cls_mechlib.cpp 3, gamez/zmodel/gmod_cull.cpp 2, gamez/zclass/cls_zbd.cpp 2, gamez/zclass/class.cpp 2, pm/gamez/zclass/cls_zbd.cpp 1, mech3/veh_controls.cpp 1, mech3/veh_basic_object.cpp 1, mech3/mech_skin.cpp 1, mech3/mech_build.cpp 1, mech3/app_turret.cpp 1, mech3/app_mech.cpp 1, gamez/zmodel/gmod_draw.cpp 1, gamez/zeffect/zeff_anim_run.cpp 1, gamez/zdeclient/zdec_crater.cpp 1, gamez/zclass/cls_util.cpp 1, gamez/zclass/cls_node.h 1) must be routed before a PM world is
drawn or collided with. PM's loader says in the log how many nodes carry a
PM model, so a PM world never silently draws nothing.

## The pieces on `mac5/pm` (2026-11-02)

- **The game table**: `src/gamez/zgame/zgame_table.h`, `zgame::Table`,
  one per game: MW3's is the default (`zgame::mw3_table()`), PM's is
  `pm::table()` (`src/pm/game/pm_game.cpp`), set by `zgame::set_game` before
  anything loads. Shared code calls a changed function through
  `zgame::game()`; each entry arrives with its port (`pm-map.md`, step 1
  onwards). For now it holds only the game's name and its exe's.
- **`pmcore`**: the library of `src/pm/`, on top of `mw3core`.
- **`mw3pm`** (`src/frontend/sdl/mw3pm_main.cpp`):
  - It takes `mw3pm [install-dir] [--write-dir DIR] [--hidden]`.
    `--fly NAME` is a debug start into one world (docs/pm-map.md, The debug
    start).
  - It uses PM's table and its own write dir: SDL's app data for "Pirate's
    Moon", apart from MW3's.
  - The install comes from the command line, else `mw3pm.cfg`'s
    `install=`, else (development builds) `game/pm`.
  - The install must be PM's: zbd/reader.zbd ends in a zArchive of version
    2. MW3's install, or a folder without reader.zbd, is refused, and the
    message says what the folder is.
  - It mounts the install and stops with "data not loadable yet" (exit 0).
- **`mw3pmtests`**: PM's own unit tests (`tests/pm/`).
- **The switch**: `-DMW3_BUILD_PM=OFF` drops all three, and `MW3PM_GAME_DIR`
  names the PM install the tests read.
- **Not yet**: the packages carry no `mw3pm`, and the launcher's entry is
  still greyed. Both come when PM plays.

## One repo, and when PM arrives

- Until MW3 is tagged `v1.0` (`release.md`, "MW3 v1.0"), `main` is MW3
  only and PM work stays on the branch `mac5/pm`.
- Before `v1.0` the launcher moves into its own program, so MW3's final
  layout is this one from the start. Done 2026-11-01: `mw3launcher`
  (launcher.md, The two programs); `mw3pm`'s entry is greyed until it sits beside
  the launcher (launcher.md, Pirate's Moon).
- After `v1.0`, `mac5/pm` merges into `main` (after the full MW3
  differential set passes on it, `pm-map.md`), and both games live on
  `main` from then on. One branch per game would mean merging every
  engine fix across by hand forever; one repo with separate folders and
  targets keeps them apart without that.
