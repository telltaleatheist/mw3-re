# Pirate's Moon: eye checks for Owen's PC

Each one: play the original at the place named, look at the port's picture beside it, answer the
question. A few minutes in all. The missions are by the numbers in their files (`readerm1`..`m10`:
world c1 has 1, 2, 5; c2 has 3, 4, 8; c3 has 6, 7; c4 has 9, 10). The places are names from each world's
`location.zrd`, so they should appear on the nav list; if one does not, near the mission's start will do.

Pictures: `claude-files/outbox/2026-11-04/pm-eye-checks/`. They come from `mw3pm --fly`, a free camera with
no cockpit, HUD, mechs or vehicles, so compare the land and sky only. The line under each makes the same
picture. Camera heights are chosen to be about a mech's eye, and the direction faced will differ.

1. **Is the first mission really this dark?** Answered (Owen, 2026-11-04, from memory and the frame 900 picture): yes,
   "the first few missions are very dark intentionally, to show off the new feature: headlights". That picture
   was taken before the sun's own colours reached the real game; look again once the mechs and headlights are in.
   Mission 1, at the start, look at the sky and the ground.
   The port shows a nearly black sky with grey clouds, though the data calls it `day`.

2. **How dark is a night mission?** Answered (Owen, 2026-11-04): "pitch black but that's likely intentional... intentionally dark for headlight use. Yes, I can see the stars." Fine. Mission 2, near Allied Camp: can you see the ground at all, and are there
   large stars? The port's ground is almost black.

3. **Is the third world's light right?** Answered (Owen, 2026-11-04): right. Mission 6 or 7, near Ruins: red ground under a black sky with red clouds, a ringed planet and a large one low down?

4. **Is that green right?** Answered (Owen, 2026-11-04): he does not remember the mission; the lighting looks fine. Mission 9 or 10, walk to Drill Rig 2: are the grids and the plain beside them this
   bright a green, and is the plain flat? The sky is dark brown here too.

5. **Are there hard lines in the ground?** Answered (Owen, 2026-11-04): looks fine. Mission 1, on open ground between the start and Pirate Base: where
   sand meets red ground, does the edge go in stair-steps? The port also shows a straight line in the ground
   texture in this picture (down the middle, a cell's edge). Does the original?

6. **Is the orange ground's edge jagged?** Answered (Owen, 2026-11-04): looks fine. Mission 3 or 4, between Neutral Camp and Germanium Camp, where the
   orange ground meets the dark ground, near the bridge. The picture also shows c2's fog and sky.
   `6-c2-bridge.png`: `mw3pm --fly c2 --pos 1536 40 -1792 --look 0 15`
7. **Are the textures this sharp?** Answered (Owen, 2026-11-04): looks fine, so `MipBias` is not urgent. Any of the above, up close. The game asks for sharper distant textures
   (`MipBias -1`), and the port does not do that yet. Is the original's far ground crisper than these pictures?
8. **A gap under the horizon? It may not be reachable.** Answered (Owen, 2026-11-04): "the black band doesn't look right. Lighting and fog looks fine." To fix, once it is known what the original shows there. Mission 3 or 4 (or 9 or 10), a mech with jump jets, on
   the highest ground you can find, at the top of a jump, looking level at the horizon: is there a band between
   the far ground and the sky, and what is in it (black, old frames smearing, nothing)? In the port it is black, with a ragged lower edge where whole cells of far ground stop. The port's pictures are
   from far higher than a jump may get, where it opens at about 96 units over the ground 600 units away;
   jets stop at 130 and 145. If a couple of jumps show nothing, the answer is "not seen", and that settles it.

   `8-c4-gap.png`: `mw3pm --fly c4 --pos 1536 150 -1792 --look 0 8`
9. **Are the small props the same?** Open (Owen, 2026-11-04): he does not remember. Mission 3 or 4 near the bridge, and mission 6 or 7 near Ruins: do the same
   small rocks and props lie on the ground in the original, about this many? They are laid at random, so their
   exact places will differ.
