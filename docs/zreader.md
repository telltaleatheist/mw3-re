# zReader: the game's data files

Mech3.exe 1.2, found with REA + Ghidra and the raw disassembly (2026-10-19).
Ported to `src/gamez/zreader/` and `src/gamez/zutil/zutl_zar.*`, checked against
the original in Unicorn on every file in `reader.zbd`
(`tests/differential/test_zreader.py`).

## Two layers

**The archive, `zutil/zutl_zar.cpp`.** A `.zbd` is a plain concatenation of files
with the table of contents at the end:

    file data ... | Entry[count] | uint32 version (1) | uint32 count

Each entry is 0x94 bytes: start, length, a 64-byte name, flags, a 64-byte comment
and a FILETIME. MW3 accepts only version 1 (`0x5767b0`); mech3ax also knows a
version 2 with a checksum, used by Zipper's later games. Names are matched with
`_stricmp`. `reader.zbd` holds 178 files (`briefing.zrd`, `mechs.zrd`,
`sounds.zrd`, ...).

**The reader, `zreader/zreader.cpp`.** Each file is one tree of 8-byte nodes,
`{int type; value}`: 1 int, 2 float, 3 string, 4 list. Stored as type then value;
a string is length then bytes; a list is a count then count - 1 nodes. In memory a
list keeps that count in its own first slot, `list[0] = {1, count}`, which is why
the stored count is one more than the items (mech3ax's reader notes the off-by-one
and guesses this; the exe confirms it).

Objects are flat lists of key/value pairs: `("CD_TRACKS" (("menu" 2) ...) ...)`.
`find` (0x5569e0) returns the node after the first string equal to the key.

The typed getters take that node: a string, a float (an int is converted), an
int, fixed lists of two or three floats or ints (0x556b70-0x556cf0; the integer
lists truncate floats with MSVCRT `_ftol`), and a boolean that is an int or one
of `true`/`on`/`false`/`off` in any case (0x556da0). Each has a keyed wrapper that
calls `find` first (0x5570b0-0x557150). A list item of the wrong type leaves that
output as it was.

## Loading

At startup (0x480000) the game points the reader at `..\data\common\zrdr` and
tries `detail.zrd`. Only if that fails does it open `zbd\reader.zbd` as the
current archive and try again, so the developers' loose text files override the
archive. `load` (0x556740) drops the directory and looks up name + extension in
each open archive, in the order they were opened. The sound module loads
`sounds.zrd` into 0x72c440 and passes its `CD_TRACKS` node to the CD code
(0x5706f0 -> 0x572450).

A name no open archive has is looked for as a loose text file (0x556240:
the path as given if `_access` finds it, else along the search path) and
read by the text branch below. None ship with the game; the controls files
the game writes, `keys\<name>.zrd`, are text (controls.md, Setup). The archive writer (0x5765b0, 0x576890, 0x576990, 0x576720) is not
ported either; the game never builds archives at run time.

## Text files (ported)

0x5563d0(handle), read a byte at a time (ReadFile, 0x5563a0). Ported in
`zreader.cpp` (`parse_text`, and `load`'s text branch), checked by
`test_zreader_text.py` on 540 files.

- **Balance check** 0x5562a0: counts `(` and `)` outside `"..."` strings and
  `;` comments (to the line's end, CR or LF); a quote inside a comment does
  not count, a `;` inside a string does not start one. Not zero: no tree
  (the load returns 0). The file is rewound.
- **Lists** 0x5563f0: tokens up to the `)` that closes the list, or the
  file's end; a `(` reads a nested list. Items are kept in order (a queue of
  8-byte nodes from a pool, 0x555cd0 at start). The root is the list of
  everything at the top level, so a file `( KEYS (...) )` gives
  `[[KEYS, [...]]]`; `find` searches nested lists anyway.
- **Tokens** 0x556510: delimited by `(`, `)` and spaces (MSVCRT isspace). A
  `;` skips to the line's end without ending the token (`ab;x\ncd` is
  `abcd`). A `"` starts a quoted part that may sit in a token's middle;
  the closing quote writes a 0 into the token, so text after it is lost
  (`"ab"cd` is `ab`), and a quoted token is always a string. A token in
  progress when the file ends is dropped.
- **Values** 0x556690: an unquoted token strtol (base 10) reads whole is an
  int (out of range: LONG_MAX or LONG_MIN), else one strtod reads whole a
  float (exponents `e`, `E`, `d`, `D`; `5.`, `.5`), else a string: `0x1c`,
  `1e`, `-` are strings.
- **Directives** 0x557550, at a token's start only: the word after `#` up to
  a space (0x557650): `ifdef NAME` (0x5577d0 looks NAME up in a list at
  0x72bf94 that nothing ever fills, so it is always false), `else`,
  `endif`; any other word is skipped. A false `#ifdef` scans for the next
  `#` (in comments and strings too) and reads directives until its `#else`
  (the else part is read) or its `#endif`; an `#else` met while reading
  skips to the `#endif`. The nesting count 0x72c1ac is global and carries
  from file to file; a stray `#endif` takes it below 0, which only shifts
  the comparisons.

Bugs, fixed in the port (fixes.md):

- An unquoted token of 256 characters or more writes its terminator over
  the low byte of the token reader's return address, which then returns
  into the middle of an instruction; the "token too long" message after
  the 257th character is never reached cleanly. FIX (bug): the token is
  dropped and the list ends, as the message intends.
- A quoted part has no length check (a stack overrun past 256) and reads on
  forever at the file's end; an `#ifdef` or `#else` whose `#endif` is
  missing scans forever at the end. FIX (bug): both stop there.
- FIX (A): stdio for ReadFile, and zutl::open (the write dir, then the
  mounts) for `_access` and the search path.

`test_zreader_text.py` runs 0x5563d0 in the emulator (the list pool 0x555cd0
and the defines list's constructor 0x557490 first; MSVCRT's strtol, strtod
and isspace as stand-ins of the same grammar as `crt::msvc_strtol` /
`msvc_strtod`) against `parse_text` on 40 controls files and 500 random
ones, the #ifdef depth carried from file to file; trees compared node by
node. Result: 540 identical (25 unbalanced). Breaking the port showed the
test catches it, 9 of 9: a comment ending the token, the balance counting
parentheses in comments, quoted tokens read as numbers, no `d` exponent,
strtol wrapping, the #else not taken, #endif not counting, items reversed,
the last token kept at the end of the file. The fixes are checked in
`mw3tests` (`zreader_text_files`).

## Original behaviour worth knowing

- `find` is depth-first through every nested list and does not tell keys from
  values: a string *value* equal to the key matches too. Kept.
- When the matching string is the last item, `find` returns the slot one past the
  end, and an empty list `()` still has its item 1 read by the typed getters.
  Both read heap memory beyond the list. In `reader.zbd` 5,597 of the 13,646
  lookups the differential test makes land there. The port gives every list one
  zeroed spare slot, so those reads mean "no value" (FIX (A), `docs/fixes.md`).
- `get_float` copies a float's bits with `mov`; only ints are converted (`fild`).
  Ghidra's pseudocode shows a cast on both, which is wrong for floats.
- `reset` (0x5766d0) does nothing when the archive has no table, so a failed open
  leaves the path for `destroy` to free.
- `get_bool_int` (0x556da0) rejects floats, and a list whose only slot is its
  count; `get_bool` (0x557150) is true only for exactly 1.

## MSVCRT pieces the reader needs

`crt::msvc_ftol` stands in for `_ftol`, the compiler's float-to-int conversion:
it truncates into 64 bits and the caller keeps the low 32, so 3e9 becomes
-1294967296; NaN and 64-bit overflow give 0x8000000000000000 (low bits 0).
`crt::msvc_stricmp` folds ASCII only, as MSVCRT does in the C locale.
