# Linux

The rebuild on Linux: the same program as on the Mac and Windows (SDL3, its
GPU API through Vulkan), built with GCC, packaged as an AppImage. Checked in
WSL2 (Ubuntu 24.04) on Owen's PC (2026-10-31).

## Building

SDL3 is too new for most distributions' packages (Ubuntu 24.04 has none), so
SDL3, SDL3_ttf and SDL3_sound are built from their release sources into a
prefix, at the Mac build's versions:

| Library | Version | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SDL3 | 3.4.12 | github.com/libsdl-org/SDL, release-3.4.12 |
| SDL3_ttf | 3.2.2 | github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf, release-3.2.2 (`-DSDLTTF_VENDORED=ON`: its own FreeType and HarfBuzz, fetched by its `external/download.sh`) |
| SDL3_sound | 3.2.0 | github.com/icculus/SDL_sound, v3.2.0 |

SDL3 needs the usual development headers for its X11, Wayland and audio
back ends (the SDL wiki's README-linux lists them); without libXtst's,
configure SDL with `-DSDL_X11_XTEST=OFF` (only synthetic input uses it).
The shaders' SPIR-V comes from `glslangValidator` (glslang-tools), found by
CMake (`MW3_HAVE_SPIRV`, sdl_render3d.glsl).

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/mw3-linux/prefix -DMW3_GAME_DIR=<an MW3 1.2 install>
cmake --build build
```

`mw3import` (the movies' and the music's importer) needs FFmpeg's shared
libraries (libavformat, libavcodec, libswscale, libavutil); without them it
is not built and the game is. The package's come from build_deps.sh (FFmpeg,
below). On Linux the
movies need it: the 32-bit Indeo helper (`mw3indeo`) is Windows-only.

### What GCC needed that clang did not

- `<cstdlib>` and `<cmath>` included where `std::malloc`, `std::fabs` and
  `std::sqrt` are used (libc++ brought them in through other headers).
- A captureless lambda against `nullptr` in `?:` (`on ? [](...){...} :
  nullptr`): GCC does not convert the lambda to the pointer type; a unary `+`
  makes it the function pointer.
- `mw3core` is linked into the differential tests' shared probe, so it is
  built position-independent (`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`; the Mac's
  default).

### What the platform layer needed

- A hidden window's frames paced: with no swapchain image to wait on
  (`--hidden`, every test), nothing made the program wait for the GPU, and
  on WSL's software Vulkan the frames fell behind by hundreds, each holding
  its cycled staging buffers: a mission's run grew 200 MB a second (3 GB in
  14 s; 0.2 GB on the Mac's Metal), and the tests that start several games
  at once ran WSL out of memory (2026-10-31, the VM's 13 GB cap; WSL's
  service then needed a `wsl --shutdown`). `SdlRender3D::present` now keeps
  one such frame in flight (a fence waited on before the next submit): the
  same run peaks at 0.28 GB.
- A window's new size synced (`SDL_SyncWindow` in `SdlWindow::create`): X11
  and Wayland apply it later, and the next frame read back at the old size
  (`sdl_layer_scales_sharp` at 1.5x).

## Where things go

- The write dir (settings, pilots, saves, the imported movies and music):
  `SDL_GetPrefPath("MicroProse", "MechWarrior 3")`, which is
  `~/.local/share/MicroProse/MechWarrior 3/` (XDG_DATA_HOME's).
- The install finder (sdl_install.cpp, `install_candidates`) looks, besides
  mw3.cfg's `install=` and the program's own folder, in a Windows install
  under Wine, Proton or Lutris: `$WINEPREFIX` (else `~/.wine`), each Steam
  `compatdata/<id>/pfx` (MW3 is not sold on Steam, so a non-Steam game's
  Proton prefix; also the Flatpak Steam's), and each `~/Games/<name>`
  prefix (Lutris), at `drive_c/Program Files (x86)/MicroProse/MechWarrior 3`
  and the usual hand-picked folders; and `~/Games/MechWarrior 3` and the
  like for a copied install.
- The launcher's font: `assets/launcher/font.ttf`, else DejaVu Sans
  Condensed Bold; the game's own fonts come from the install.
- The MechWarrior (1989) entry looks for `mechwarrior` (no `.exe`) beside
  `mw3` (docs/launcher.md).

## Packaging

`tools/linux/make-appimage.sh [PREFIX] [TOOLS]` builds
`build-linux-pkg/dist/MW3-Rebuild-<version>-x86_64.AppImage`: its own build
tree with `MW3_PACKAGE`, then linuxdeploy (the libraries `mw3` and
`mw3import` load, SDL's from PREFIX) and appimagetool, both from their
GitHub releases (continuous). In the AppDir:

- `usr/bin/mw3`, `usr/bin/mw3import` when built, and
  `usr/bin/assets/launcher/` (the launcher's art, where `SDL_GetBasePath`
  finds it);
- `usr/share/doc/mw3/`: README.txt, THIRD-PARTY.txt, LICENSE.txt, the SDL
  libraries' licence files;
- the desktop entry and icon (tools/linux: `mw3.desktop`, `mw3.png`, our
  emblem at 256).

Vulkan, X11, Wayland and the audio servers stay the system's: SDL loads them
at run time, and linuxdeploy's exclude list keeps them out. `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1`
runs the tools (and the AppImage) without FUSE, as in WSL or a container.

## Checking

- Under WSL2 (2026-10-31): `mw3tests` 262 tests, 0 failed; `mw3sdltests`
  each test on its own under `run_capped.py --mem-gb 5` (7 for
  `sdl_program_screens_are_not_blank`, which starts ten games at once;
  3 GB peak). Run them one at a time with a cap there: WSL's VM is shared
  and capped, and a run that outgrows it takes the whole distro down.
- WSL stops a distro once no wsl.exe client is attached, so a long job is
  run attached (in the foreground of the session), not left with nohup.
- The differential tests (tests/differential, Python with Unicorn) need a
  Python with `unicorn` installed; WSL's system Python has none.
- WSLg gives a Wayland and X display (`WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0`), so a
  window and a shot can be tried there.

## FFmpeg (mw3import)

The package's FFmpeg is a minimal LGPL 2.1 build from its pinned release
source (Owen, 2026-10-31): `tools/deps/build_deps.sh linux` (docs/deps.md)
builds it with SDL3, SDL3_ttf (FreeType inside) and SDL3_sound into
`build-deps/linux/prefix`, which `make-appimage.sh` takes as PREFIX
(pkg-config finds FFmpeg there; the licence files come from the sources).
Only what mw3import uses is in it: the AVI demuxer, the Indeo 5 decoder, the
MPEG-1 video encoder and muxer, swscale, the file protocol. For WSL the
script leaves out SDL's XTest (no libXtst headers) and, where nasm is
missing, FFmpeg's x86 assembly.

Checked under WSL (2026-10-31): the AppImage's `--import --movie INTRO`
converted the 19 movies in 35 s (0.22 GB) and played the intro.
