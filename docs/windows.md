# Building and running on Windows

The same code as on the Mac, built with clang-cl (the Mac's compiler family,
so the floats round alike: `-ffp-contract=off` under both) and Ninja against
Visual Studio's headers and libraries.

## What it needs

- Visual Studio (2022 or later) with the C++ tools; its Windows SDK brings
  `dxc`, which compiles the Direct3D 12 shaders.
- LLVM's clang-cl on the PATH (`scoop install llvm`, or Visual Studio's
  "C++ Clang tools" component).
- SDL3 and SDL3_ttf: their `-VC.zip` development releases unpacked into
  `deps\` (git-ignored), e.g. `deps\SDL3-3.4.12`, `deps\SDL3_ttf-3.2.2`.
- Optional, for .ogg, .flac and .mp3 music (without it the music plays
  `.wav` tracks only): SDL3_sound's `SDL3_sound-devel-3.2.0-VC.zip`
  (github.com/icculus/SDL_sound, releases) unpacked into `deps\` as
  `deps\SDL3_sound-3.2.0`; build.cmd hands it to CMake as
  `SDL3_sound_ROOT`, which an existing `build-win\` also picks up on its
  next configure. Its decoders are built in (stb_vorbis, dr_flac, dr_mp3).
- For the movies' importer only (developers; the package has none):
  FFmpeg's shared libraries, BtbN's LGPL
  build `ffmpeg-n8.1-latest-win64-lgpl-shared-8.1.zip` (github.com/BtbN/
  FFmpeg-Builds, releases, "latest") unpacked into `deps\` as
  `deps\ffmpeg-n8.1-latest-win64-lgpl-shared-8.1` (its `include\`,
  `lib\*.lib` and `bin\*.dll`). Any shared build with those three folders
  does (CMake takes the first `deps\ffmpeg-*shared*`, or `-DFFMPEG_DIR`).
  It has FFmpeg's own Indeo 5 decoder and MPEG-1 encoder, which is all the
  importer uses. Without it `mw3import` is not built; the game is.

## Building

`tools\windows\build.cmd` finds Visual Studio (vswhere), configures
`build-win\` once and builds `mw3` (or the targets given). The build copies
the DLLs mw3.exe links (`SDL3.dll`, `SDL3_ttf.dll`, `SDL3_sound.dll`) next
to it. `mw3soundcheck --music FILE` plays a music file through the game's
music player for 3 s and says whether this build decodes it.
`tools\windows\build.cmd mw3 mw3import` also builds the importer, and its
build copies FFmpeg's DLLs next to `mw3import.exe`; give a player the two
exes and all the DLLs in one folder (FFmpeg 8.1's are nine). On Owen's PC
(2026-10-30): the 19 movies in 29 s; their `.wav` and `.fmv` files are
the Mac's byte for byte, the `.m1v` differ by FFmpeg build but play either
way; `--cue` on his MW3 disc image gives track02 (191.9 s) and track03
(186.1 s).

## The Indeo helper

`tools\windows\build_indeo.cmd` builds `build-win\mw3indeo.exe`, the
32-bit helper that plays the movies through the install's own Indeo 5
codec (fmv.md, The Indeo helper): `clang-cl -m32` under `vcvarsall x86`,
one file, Windows' own libraries, the CRT linked in, a GUI program (no
console when mw3 starts it). With it beside `mw3.exe` the movies need no
FFmpeg and no import. Its check, from the repo, with the install at
`C:\Games\MW3` (any 1.0 or 1.2 install):

    deps\ffmpeg-n8.1-latest-win64-lgpl-shared-8.1\bin\ffmpeg.exe -i C:\Games\MW3\video\C1M1.AVI -vf "fps=15,select=eq(n\,100)" -frames:v 1 -f rawvideo -pix_fmt rgb565le ref100.565
    start /wait "" build-win\mw3indeo.exe --check C:\Games\MW3\Ir50_32.dll C:\Games\MW3\video\C1M1.AVI 100 c1m1-100 ref100.565 > check.txt

`check.txt` says whether the codec loaded and ICOpen gave its driver (its
name and description), the movie's size and frames, every frame decoded in
order (key frames and the frames between, as the player decodes them) with
the time a frame, frame 100 written as `c1m1-100.bmp` and `c1m1-100.565`,
its PSNR against FFmpeg's decode of the same frame (the optional last
argument; `fps=15` keeps FFmpeg's frame n the AVI's sample n, repeating the
picture for the packets Indeo gives none for, 105 of C1M1's 690;
FFmpeg's Indeo 5 is its own decoder, so close, not equal), and
which `ir50*`, AVIFile and VfW DLLs the process loaded.

## Packaging

`tools\windows\package.cmd` makes the package for other players:
`build-win\dist\mw3-<git describe>-win64\` and its `.zip`. It configures
its own tree, `build-win-pkg\`, from scratch with `-DMW3_PACKAGE=ON` (mw3
then carries no development copy of the game: only the player's install,
through the finder or mw3.cfg's `install=`), builds `mw3` and, 32-bit,
`mw3indeo` (build_indeo.cmd into the same tree), and collects:

- `mw3.exe`, `mw3indeo.exe`, the DLLs mw3's build copied beside it (SDL3,
  SDL3_ttf, SDL3_sound), and the Visual C++ runtime from Visual Studio's
  redist folder (app-local; the helper links its CRT in);
- `README.txt` and `THIRD-PARTY.txt` (`tools\windows\dist\`), each
  `deps\SDL3*` folder's own `LICENSE*`/`COPYING*` files under
  `licenses\`, pl_mpeg's and miniz's.

No FFmpeg and no mw3import (Owen, 2026-10-30: no FFmpeg to keep up unless
it is needed): the movies play through the helper and the player's own
Ir50_32.dll (fmv.md, The Indeo helper), and the disc image's music is
`mw3 --cue` (fmv.md, Music). `mw3import` and FFmpeg stay for developers
(the Mac's movies, and the fall-back where the helper fails), built when
FFmpeg is found as before: BtbN's LGPL build in `deps\` (What it needs),
whose notices `ffmpeg_notices.ps1` lists for a package that would carry it.

`check_dist.ps1` then checks with `dumpbin /dependents` that every DLL the
exes and DLLs import is in the folder or Windows' own (System32 or an
`api-ms-win-*` set; the VC++ runtime must be in the folder), and that no game
file is in it. `mw3.exe` has a version resource (ProductName "MechWarrior 3
rebuild", the version from `git describe`, the commit count as the build
number; `tools\windows\version.rc.in`) and our placeholder icon
(`tools\windows\mw3.ico`, a green reticle drawn by `make_icon.py`;
nothing of the game's or MicroProse's). `mw3 --version` and `mw3import
--version` print the version and need no window, so they show over ssh
that the programs and every DLL load.


- The install: `mw3.exe C:\path\to\MechWarrior3`, or an `install=` line in
  `mw3.cfg` in the write dir (`%APPDATA%\MicroProse\MechWarrior 3\`).
- Any version's data runs (assets.md, Data versions); `mw3` prints which at
  start ("data version 1.2", "1.0", "1.0 with 1.2 files" with the counts, or
  the files that are neither). An install with the 1.2 `Mech3.exe` copied
  over older data (seen on one PC) is older data: 1.0's `reader.zbd` lacks
  hud.zrd's 1152x864, 1280x1024 and 1600x1200 blocks (it has 800x600 and
  1024x768), and its `interp.zbd` and campaign 3's missions differ.
- The movies: through `mw3indeo.exe` beside `mw3.exe` and the install's
  Ir50_32.dll (The Indeo helper), with nothing imported. Without the helper
  (or when it fails), on a player's first plain start, when the write dir's
  `video\` lacks the install's movies and `mw3import.exe` is beside
  `mw3.exe`, mw3 runs it for the missing ones with a small progress window
  (about a minute for the 19; fmv.md section 6). Without the importer the
  game plays without movies, as before; `--import` runs it again after a
  failed try, `--no-import` skips it. A set made on another machine can be
  copied into `video\` instead.
- The music: `mw3 --cue "D:\path\disc.cue"` (or `mw3import --cue ...
  --music-only`) writes a
  disc image's audio tracks as `music\trackNN.wav` in the write dir
  (fmv.md section 6, Music).
- Fullscreen by default (borderless, the desktop's size, the frame fitted);
  `--windowed`, `--window WxH` or `windowed=1` in `mw3.cfg` keep a window.
- It must run in a desktop session: over ssh there is no swapchain
  (`SDL_ClaimWindowForGPUDevice` fails with 0x887A0022).

## A crash

Windows' event log (Application, event 1000) gives the exception code and
the fault offset in mw3.exe. The build keeps symbols (mw3.pdb beside the
exe), so `llvm-symbolizer --obj=build-win\mw3.exe --inlining
--relative-address 0x<offset>` names the function and line.

## The renderer

`sdl_render3d.hlsl` is the Direct3D 12 twin of `sdl_render3d.cpp`'s Metal
shaders; CMake runs `dxc` on it for each entry point and the renderer takes
DXIL when the device offers it. The viewer (`tools/viewer`) is Metal only.

## Not yet built on Windows

The tests (`mw3tests`, `mw3sdltests`; several use POSIX process calls,
guarded), `mw3import` (FFmpeg), the viewer's shaders.
