# Pirate's Moon: the function map and a porting order

Plan stage (2026-10-31, dev 2, branch `mac5/pm`): nothing ported. Builds on
`docs/pirates-moon.md` (the copy, the data, the function diff's method) with
the map against the port, the differential tests and the data formats.
Regenerate: `tools/analysis/pmdiff.py` (the pairs), then
`tools/analysis/pmmap.py` (the tables below; `analysis-output/pm-diff/
port-impact.txt` lists every ported function PM changed or dropped).

## The categories

Of MW3 1.2's 8,030 functions and PM 1.0's 8,567 (unwind funclets aside):

| | functions | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| identical | 1,488 | the same instructions once addresses are named by what they point at |
| compiler only | 3,856 | other instructions, the same calls, strings, constants and imports: PM was rebuilt with Visual C++ 6 (MW3: 5.0). Of these, 1,102 read or write struct fields at other offsets and 219 compare other small constants (pmflags.py); the rest, 2,642, look like the same source |
| changed | 1,531 | calls, strings, constants or imports added or removed: a source change |
| moved | 630 of the paired | paired, but the source range they sit in has another name (PM's tree is `branchep1\mech3ep1\...`); counted within the rows above |
| new in PM | 1,692 | no MW3 twin |
| gone (MW3 only) | 1,155 | no PM twin: removed (the movies, the fog, the old text reader), inlined by VC6, or rewritten past recognition |

"Compiler only" is not proof of the same source. pmdiff.py counts constants
from 0x100 up only, and not field offsets, so a struct that grew and a
small constant that changed both pass as "compiler only"; pmflags.py checks
both (above). Its median is 11 instructions different; 565 differ in more
than 50. A sample of 30 of those 565 (random, seed 1), read as pseudocode
(`tools/analysis/pmlogic.py`, names and addresses normalised): 15 read
fields at other offsets (the anim definition, the mech, the weapon and
vehicle classes grew in PM), one of them also changing logic (0x509640, the
anim definitions' node lookup: a check added that the second lookup is not
the first's node, and a flag test dropped); 1 more changes logic (0x43f660,
a constructor: a type byte 2 -> 3, set with a mov pmflags.py does not
check, and another vtable); 2 compare other small constants; and 12 are the
compiler or Ghidra (argument recovery, inlining, x87 compares decoded
another way, early returns for nested ifs). Of all 565, 237 read other
offsets and 86 compare other constants.

The port has 4,044 addresses; 115 are not in the diff (data tables, thunks
and functions Ghidra did not make). For the port: **1,683 (42%) need
nothing** (identical, or rebuilt with the same field offsets and constants),
**817 were rebuilt but read other field offsets or compare other constants**
(a struct whose layout PM changed: the logic may be the same, the layout is
PM's), **950 changed** and **479 are gone in PM**. Each changed or gone one is
listed with what changed in `port-impact.txt`; the offsets and constants of
the 817 in `compiler-flags.json` (`tools/analysis/pmflags.py`).

Left out on purpose (2026-11-05): PM's in-game file boxes for the lab's developer keys, 0x48fef0 (save) and 0x490120 (open), with their 0x490270 and 0x4907c0. They replace MW3's Windows dialogs on Ctrl+X and Ctrl+I, a developer path; the port's `export\\` and `import\\` stand-in does the job.

## Running the differential tests on PM (step 0, 2026-10-31)

**Eye checks of mech movement mean little until the mech step is PM's (`docs/pm-tests.md`): MW3's logic stands in and looks right.** **Tests loading libmw3probe do not test this branch.** `mw3probe` is not built here; they now fail at the import. By-test list: `docs/pm-tests.md`.

**The address map** (`tools/analysis/pmaddr.py`, after pmdiff.py; writes
`analysis-output/pm-diff/addrmap.json`):

| | mapped |
|---|---|
| functions | 6,891 (pmdiff's 6,875 pairs, and 16 short functions by their instructions) |
| instructions inside them | 231,054 (each pair's instructions aligned; a hook mid-function lands on its twin) |
| import slots | 450 of 474 (by DLL and name, else the name alone: msvcp50 -> msvcp60); the 24 PM does not import (the movie DLLs, realloc, the critical sections) go to a scratch page |
| import thunks (`jmp [slot]`) | 236, by their translated instruction |
| globals | 11,224 addresses in 1,365 blocks: aligned instructions' operands, paired in order; an address between two pairs of a block (same delta) maps by it |
| vtable and callback-table slots | 14,710 of 15,446: each slot to the PM slot holding its function's twin whose table agrees most around it (sibling classes share their base's first slots) |

Left to chance: code nothing maps is looked for by its first 24 bytes in
PM's code (unique hits only).

**`original.py` on PM's exe** (`MW3_EXE=pm`): every image address a test
gives `call`, `read`, `write`, `u32`, `stub_import`, `stub_function` and
`import_code` is translated; `cpu.uc` is a proxy that translates hook
ranges and memory addresses and gives hook callbacks MW3's addresses back;
an address the map lacks raises `Unmapped`. The helpers that read the exe
themselves (`twod_world.iat_slots`, `calltrace`'s ret decoding and memory
snapshot) read MW3's and let the map translate. `run_exit.py` runs a test
and leaves with `os._exit`, since a failing test's normal exit can hang
Unicorn's process at exit on this Mac (the stuck UE processes).

**Gate before mac5/pm merges (after MW3 v1.0):** the full MW3 differential
set must pass on this branch (`pm_survey.py --exe mw3`, every test). Step 0
touched the shared harness: `original.py` (Original's own `uc` renamed
`_uc`, `uc` the same emulator on MW3; a scratch page mapped at 0x2e080000),
`calltrace.py` and `twod_world.py` (paths taken only on PM's exe). On MW3,
checked so far: test_exe_select, test_hud, test_fade, test_twod_msgbox,
test_ztimer, test_action_lists, test_actions, test_actionscreen, all pass;
the full run (6 to 10 hours, one test at a time) is left for before the
merge (the lead, 2026-10-31).

**The survey** (`tests/differential/pm_survey.py`: each test once on PM's
exe, one at a time, classed by the MW3 functions it names; results in
`analysis-output/pm-diff/survey.json`):

| the test's functions | tests | pass | unmapped | emulator error | mismatch | other |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| all unchanged (identical or compiler only) | 13 | 5 | 2 | 5 | 0 | 1 |
| some changed | 62 | 0 | 20 | 33 | 4 | 5 |
| some gone | 118 | 0 | 88 | 21 | 4 | 5 (1 time limit) |

Passing on PM as they stand: `test_ai_lists`, `test_motion`, `test_spans`,
`test_twod_blit`, `test_ztimer` (and `test_exe_select`). So of the tests
whose functions PM left alone, 5 of 13 carry over now; the 8 others fail on
the map or on a test's own MW3 assumptions (a struct size, a vtable slot
offset it patches in a copy, a global the map placed by a block's delta),
not on a difference found. Where a test names a changed or gone function it
fails, as it should: 8 real mismatches, the rest stopped before comparing.

What blocks most: a "gone" function the test stubs or calls (PM inlined
it: 0x40cbf0 `set_hw_card_dev`, 0x576e70's wrapper, 0x58468e), globals
outside the map's blocks (0x4e8f34, 0x5031b0), and the tests' fixed struct
and vtable offsets. Each module's tests are made to run on PM when that
module is ported for PM (step 1 onwards), with the PM version beside the
MW3 one.

## Does PM need MW3? (Owen, 2026-11-02)

No. PM's exe looks for nothing of MW3's, and the PM disc alone makes a
complete install (game/pm). What the exe reaches outside its folder:

- The registry: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\MicroProse\MechWarrior 3 EP1\<version>`
  (its own key: `InstallOptions` 0x5b9330, the settings 0x4826e0), and
  `HKLM\Software\Zipper\MechWarrior3\<version>\RunDir` (0x4852f0), the
  developer's key both games carry (protection.md section 1's RunDir; no
  installer writes it).
- The disc check 0x4854e0: `data.tag` on any CD-ROM drive (scanner
  0x5967c0). MW3's disc has a `DATA.TAG` too (both are InstallShield
  discs), so the original took an MW3 disc for PM's. MW3's own check looks
  for `video\c1.avi`. Not ported (the trap list, protection.md).
- A file not found where named is looked for on the CD-ROM drives
  (0x5c9bb0 through 0x5968d0), the movies among them, as MW3's. PM's
  disc has no VIDEO folder; whether a movie name PM's install lacks could
  be found on an MW3 disc is unchecked (the port plays imported movies
  only, so it cannot).
- The search paths are relative to the run folder (`zbd`, and
  `..\data\...` from the developer's tree).

The port: mw3pm mounts its own install and its write dir only (and mods),
names stay inside them (`zutl::Mounts::confined`, path-guard), and none of
the ported PM readers names an MW3 path. The check to repeat once mw3pm
loads data (step 1's end): a run with only game/pm mounted reaches the
menus and a mission, and the log shows no file outside it.

## The data formats against mech3ax

mech3ax reads PM (`GameType::PM`). Checked against the PM install's files:

| Format | MW3 | PM | mech3ax | Checked here |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| zArchive | version 1 | version 2: count, then a checksum | `archive`: the checksum is the CRC (polynomial 0x04c11db7, MSB first, init 0, no xor: our `zutl_zar::crc32`) over every entry's data in order, for readers only; 0 for mechlib, motion and sounds; motion's entries store length 1 | all 54 v2 archives: 50 readers' CRCs match, the 4 others hold 0; motion.zbd's 364 entries have length 1 (so the exe finds a motion's end by reading it) |
| gamez.zbd | 27, 0x24 header | 41, 0x28 header (a time stamp at +8) | `gamez/pm`: `HeaderPmC` | the 4 worlds: signature 0x02971222, version 41, time stamps of 1999-11-12 |
| anim.zbd | 39 | 50 | `anim/pm` | the 4 worlds: version 50 |
| mechlib.zbd | 27 | 41 | `gamez/mechlib` `VERSION_PM` | version 41 (docs/pirates-moon.md) |
| models, nodes | MW | PM layouts | `gamez/model/pm`, `nodes/pm` (13 files) | to port from the exe, with mech3ax as the check, as for MW3 |
| interp.zbd, motions, textures | | the same (textures: a third field) | no PM variant | read by the port today |

## Shared types, forked logic

**Replaced (Owen, 2026-11-04): this branch, `pm`, is PM's own copy and never merges to `main`** (`games-layout.md`).
New work edits `src/gamez` and `src/mech3` in place, or forks where plainly easier; `src/pm/` and `zgame::Table`
stay as they are and fold in only when that code is being worked on. A bug or port error MW3 also has goes to the lead
as its own small commit. The section below is how the branch got here.

Shared types by field, fork only logic (the lead, 2026-11-02). The same
1999 source means shared code in ours. A struct that grew between the games
is a binary artefact, not a reason to fork: pmdiff's "compiler only, other
offsets" functions (1,102) are MW3's source compiled over larger structs,
and the port names its fields (offsets only in comments), so those
functions run unchanged on PM. So:

- One type per engine struct (zcls::Node, World, Light, Lod and the rest),
  holding the union of both games' fields by name; a field only one game
  has is commented "PM only, +0x..". A file's layout (PM's 16-bit counts)
  is the reader's business, not the struct's.
- Readers are per game: PM's fill the shared types from PM's files.
- A function is forked only where PM's logic changed, through the game
  table (zgame::Table), as the archive and the text reader are.
- Shared code that reads a struct by raw offset (`get<T>(0x..)`,
  `raw[0x..]`) couples it to one game's layout; those reads become named
  fields, module by module, with MW3's tests as the guard. The count on
  2026-11-02: 515 get/put sites on Node, World, Light and Lod, 78 direct
  `raw[]` reads, 163 uses of the int32 count accessors, mostly in zClass.

The route for PM's world files (the lead, 2026-11-02): PM's readers
translate the file into the shared types as they are, in MW3's layout:
the counts as MW3's int32 (+0x54, +0x5c), the box centre and diagonal at
+0x64/+0x70, World's rows, lights and sounds where MW3 keeps them. PM's
extra fields are real C++ members outside the raw block (`Node::pm_virtual`,
`pm_box`, `pm_model`; `World::pm_area2`, `Light::pm_colors`, `Lod::pm_tail`,
`Partition::pm_tail` and `pm_y`), so MW3's raw readers never meet them.
PM's ported functions use the shared accessors, never PM's raw offsets,
with a one-line comment where the offset differs. A node's model is
`model` (MW3's) or `pm_model` (PM's; `model` stays null): the shared code
reading `model` (73 places: gamez/zeffect/zeff_anim_events.cpp 11, gamez/zclass/cls_di.cpp 8, gamez/zeffect/zeff_anim_save.cpp 7, gamez/zclass/cls_node.cpp 7, gamez/zclass/camera.cpp 6, gamez/zinterp/zinterp.cpp 5, gamez/zgeometry/zgeo_model.cpp 5, mech3/zainet_inout.cpp 3, gamez/zclass/cls_mechlib.cpp 3, gamez/zmodel/gmod_cull.cpp 2, gamez/zclass/cls_zbd.cpp 2, gamez/zclass/class.cpp 2, pm/gamez/zclass/cls_zbd.cpp 1, mech3/veh_controls.cpp 1, mech3/veh_basic_object.cpp 1, mech3/mech_skin.cpp 1, mech3/mech_build.cpp 1, mech3/app_turret.cpp 1, mech3/app_mech.cpp 1, gamez/zmodel/gmod_draw.cpp 1, gamez/zeffect/zeff_anim_run.cpp 1, gamez/zdeclient/zdec_crater.cpp 1, gamez/zclass/cls_util.cpp 1, gamez/zclass/cls_node.h 1) must be routed before a PM world is
drawn or collided with, apart from the walk, the model box and the header (The
debug start, below). PM's loader says in the log how many nodes carry a PM model, so a PM
world never silently draws nothing.

See docs/games-layout.md.

## The debug start (2026-11-04)

`mw3pm --fly c1 [--pos X Y Z] [--look YAW PITCH] [--shot FILE.bmp]` draws one
PM world through the real path: `pm::zcls` read, textures, the shared walk
`zcls::render_world`, `zmod::DrawTable`, `Render3D`
(`src/frontend/pm_debug_world.cpp`). It is a debug flag; the program otherwise
still stops at "data not loadable yet". All four worlds draw.

The models go through 0x543b10's own draw and device (`draw_pm_model`; sections below). Stubbed:
the camera's far clip (the file's 800 is opened to 4,000; the game's own setter is not ported),
world.zrd, sky, clutter, the world class's update, the interpreter's commands.

What the walk needed from the shared code for PM's nodes
(`test_pm_walk.py` runs PM's world render 0x50a9e0 against the exe, draw by draw,
with LoD fields and a ranged light edited, since shipped data reaches neither):

- `node_model_header` goes through the game table, and `draw_model_of`, the
  hidden-surface test's "has lights" and the callers that ask "has it a model"
  read it. PM sets a morphing LoD's flag 8 and factor on its model just as MW3
  does (0x507f30, 0x4f4ab0).
- `node_model_box` (MW3 0x4ed220, PM 0x4fef40) goes through the table. PM's
  0x55b1c0 and 0x55b360 read the same header offsets as MW3's 0x53b4e0 and
  0x53b680, so PM's calls the shared `zmod::model_box`.
- `node_box_corners` (MW3 0x4ebdb0, PM 0x4fda40) reads PM's box through its
  pointer (`pm_box`, PM's +0x70). It read box 0, empty on PM's world nodes, so
  every sphere sat at the origin and whole cells went missing depending on where
  the origin stood against the view.
- PM's LoD (0x5c bytes) has three more words at +0x34; MW3's +0x34..+0x4f are at
  its +0x40. `translate_lod` keeps MW3's layout in `raw` and the three words,
  whose use is unknown, in `pm_tail`. Read as they were, every fade, the uniform
  scale flag and the morph were the wrong fields.
- The cells (0x509dd0 against 0x4f6720), by the table's data: a light's "reaches
  this cell" bit is 0x800 (0x200 is PM's static bit); its reach test takes off the
  wrapped camera offset ([0x8d43b0]); PM has no fades on a cell. Its +0x40 count
  is another list, entries 0x5c bytes: over 20 of them call 0x504450, which is
  ported now (cls_clutter), and the draw 0x50a1e0 needs [0x60d968], which is 1 in the exe's data and
  which nothing writes, so it is always on.

Left for the world class:

- The box writer is ported (`pm/gamez/zclass/cls_world`, 0x4fe740 with 0x505300, 0x505550, 0x506000, 0x505c80,
  0x4fd8d0, 0x4ff660; `test_pm_world_box.py`, through the table's `zcls_node_bound_box`): +0x70 points at the box it
  chose, +0x74 only for the union of two, and `node_box` follows it. A LoD's scale multiplies the chosen box in
  place, so that box would grow at every call past a scale of 1. It cannot happen on shipped data: all 743 LoDs of
  the four worlds have 0, 0, 0 there, and mechlib has none (2026-11-04). Whether anything sets them at run time was not
  searched for. A node fitting one cell is on its list with a y range; a
  node across more is among the world's children with the range kept. `node_box_xz` and two more reads of +0x74
  in `class.cpp` have not met PM's nodes. The cell's update is ported (0x504a40, `world_cell_update`, through the table's `zcls_area_update`; 0x504fb0 runs it
  on the pending cells): the height from the nodes' y ranges and, when its records changed, theirs, then the tree
  dropped to be built anew. A quirk kept: the records' second loop starts over at the first found but counts from past
  it, so the cell's last record is not looked at. Compared in `test_pm_world_box.py` and `test_pm_clutter.py`. The laying
  queues its cells for real now (0x5043d0). The grid maker (0x505820: MW3's plus the second area, a margin past the first, and a limit of 0x7fff cells each
  way) and adding a child (0x505ea0: a node with no box goes by the point its matrix puts it at, not MW3's whole world)
  are ported, through the table, and compared there too, with nodes taken off and put back and three grids. Removing
  a light or a sound is MW3's with PM's offsets, shared and not compared here. `world_set_origin`, `world_set_size` and
  `world_set_margins` (0x505760, 0x5057c0, 0x505bf0) keep the second area, compared too. Zones wait on W58's merge.
- `shadow_model_morphed` reads `node->model` and so returns on a PM node, safely,
  without casting: to route in phase 4.

The rest of the walk needed no fork: PM's 0x509830, 0x5092a0 and 0x5050e0 are MW3's
with PM's offsets.

Seen on screen, not yet explained: polygons with flag 0x2000 are strips (drawn as
triangles here); a large unlit shape in each world's view from the middle (black
in c1, c3 and c4, tan in c2), which may be a dome or a sky piece the game moves;
in c4 a flat green area beside the grid texture, which may be a priority or
overlay matter this draw leaves out; c1's stair-stepped sand and red edges and a
jagged orange edge low in c2, which may be what the transparency and priority stubs
do. Each is to check under the real draw against an original screenshot or the
data, not by assuming.

## The frame's box window

Pirate's Moon does one thing to every entity around the frame that MW3 did
to none of them, and everything a shot can land on depends on it. MW3's
0x41aba0 ran on the pilot's mech alone, at the tail of its update; PM's
player tick (0x4a4490) calls 0x4a4440 instead:

1. 0x5cb4e0: each entity of the list at 0x8d3ac0, vt+0x34.
2. The player's vehicle, vt+0x38.
3. If [0x609920], 0x5cb540: vt+0x38 of each entity with +9 set.
4. 0x5cb510: each entity, vt+0x3c.

The slots exist on the mech (vtable 0x5dfaac: 0x41b900, 0x41ae00, 0x41b930),
the field base (0x5e4a20), the stealth object (0x5ea8d0), the basic vehicle
(0x5eaeac) and the vehicle base (0x5eb2ac, which has no instance). Turrets
and the targets don't take part. Before the frame a mech detaches its
headlight (0x479c30 through 0x41f930), and 0x4b2d70, if the entity is active,
saves the root's box bit (0x20, 0x4fd310) in +0xdc and sets it. After the
frame the mech takes +0x6d4 = dt, aims the parts (0x41e4d0), runs the ammo
gauge and aim state and clears +0x688 if it is the pilot's vehicle (0x4b4c70),
attaches the headlight (0x479c60); 0x4b2da0 then puts the saved bit back.

So a root is a box only while mechs move and look; beams and shots cast in
the weapon_tick action, a separate node, with every root back to its meshes.
That is what a hit on a part needs: a root with 0x20 answers the segment
itself (`line_gate`, `line_take`), `node_part` finds nothing, and the hit
spreads 14.3% over the body, never the head. **A port that sets the box at the
build and has no window makes the enemy nearly unkillable**: 276 to 431 hits
each on c1m1, none on a part.

**Order.** The reticle's ray 0x445cf0 runs from the reticle's place 0x445fe0,
called from the mech's update (0x41afc5, through 0x41dcd0), so inside step 2 with
every root boxed. It sets the near contacts' box off (0x445c60 with 0, at 0x445d9d),
casts, and sets it on (with 1, at 0x445efa) whatever it was, which is right
there, and step 4 restores them all. So the order of the list changes nothing.

Everything else in the list keeps only the box: the field base, stealth object,
basic vehicle and vehicle base have 0x4b2d70 and 0x4b2da0 themselves in +0x34 and
+0x3c, their update apart. Of a mech's +0x3c, the gauge and the clear of +0x688
are the pilot's vehicle's alone ([0x62c40c]+0x14).

**How many hits.** PM's 0x414430 sets the leg's scale [0x6040a4] to 0.5 alone
and on a network; MW3's 0x413e60 has 1 alone. So PM's legs take half what
MW3's do, and the arithmetic (`apply_damage`, damage_scale 0.0062) gives, for 10
damage: Thor 12, Shadow Cat 10, Clint 9, Epona 8, at 15 damage 8, 7, 6, 5.
`PM_LEG=5` reaches that in the mission on the same five mechs.

## A porting order

Each step is a sitting or a few, as for MW3; the counts are the port's
functions PM changed, and PM's new ones.

0. **The test bench**: the address map and `original.py`'s translation
   above, so every later step is checked against PM's exe.
1. **The readers**: zArchive version 2 (the CRC check, motion's lengths);
   `zrdr_main.cpp`, the reader rewritten (122 new functions against 61 of
   MW3's `zreader.cpp`); gamez.zbd 41 and its node, material and model
   changes (zClass 166 changed, zModel 54); anim.zbd 50 (zEffect 28);
   mechlib 41. Nothing loads before these.
   - **zArchive 2: done** (2026-11-02, `src/pm/gamez/zutil/zutl_zar`, through
     PM's `zgame::Table`):
     - The table reader 0x597610 and writer 0x597570, the CRC of every entry
       0x597a30, its check 0x597a10 and the file check 0x597af0. The object
       is 0x1c bytes, with the checksum at +0x18.
     - The only check is a tamper trap (protection.md section 6), left out
       when PM's Intro state is ported.
     - Motion's lengths of 1: PM's exe reads a motion from its start to its
       end. The port's bounded reader takes PM's bound as up to the next
       entry's start (else the table's), mech3ax's backfill. MW3 keeps an
       entry's length. A broken PM motion is still refused.
     - Tests:
       - `test_pm_zar.py` on PM's exe: the 54 shipped archives, damaged
         copies, 200 random reads and 50 writes, and mech3ax's rules on
         every shipped file. 0 mismatches.
       - `mw3pmtests`: all 364 motions load; a cut one is refused.
     - Left: `mods.cpp`'s `--check-mod` and the mod loaders still bound an
       entry by its stored length. When PM takes mods, they go through
       `zutl_zar::span` too.
   - **The reader (`zrdr_main.cpp`): done** (2026-11-02,
     `src/pm/gamez/zreader/zrdr_main`; zreader.md, Pirate's Moon):
     - Rewritten as a C++ object over the same files. Every function MW3
       also has returns what MW3's does, so the port keeps zrdr's for
       them. New: three getters, a stack of 32 open files, and `#include`
       in text files (through `zgame::Table::zrdr_parse_text`).
     - Tests:
       - `test_pm_zreader.py` on PM's exe: all 1,052 entries of the 50
         reader archives, and every getter on 52,337 keys.
       - `test_pm_zreader_text.py` on PM's exe: 840 text files, 300 of
         them with `#include`.
       - `mw3pmtests`: `pm_text_files_take_include`, and
         `pm_include_stays_inside_the_mounts` (`..`, a full path and
         `sub/../..` read nothing; ours, for mods).
   - **gamez.zbd 41 (done: (c1) textures and materials, (c2) models,
     (c3) nodes and the entry)**: PM's world file loader stacks files.
     Every gamez.zbd read appends to the material, model and node pools
     (MW3's replaced them), so one world can be made of several files.
     - Entry 0x516bc0 (MW3 0x4ff520). It keeps a list of the loaded files
       (0x639c28, 0x2c each: the path, then the 0x28 header; count
       0x639c2c, the current one 0x60ea00, the open file 0x639c30).
       The texture directory is read only while none is loaded
       (0x531860 = its count 0x63e1e8), so the first file's stays. The
       material reader returns its base index, which goes to the model
       reader; the model base goes to the node reader 0x516e90.
       A failure pops the entry (0x517a70).
     - Open 0x5179e0: the 0x28 header, signature 0x02971222, version
       0x29.
     - Textures 0x531920 (MW3 0x518160): entries of 0x2c at 0x63e1ec
       (the image +0, +4, the surface +8, the name +0xc, the state +0x20,
       set to 2, the group +0x24, the mip +0x28, zeroed: no mip chain).
     - Materials 0x555e00 (MW3 0x5363d0): same 0x2c layout and flags.
       It appends at the current count (blocks 0x6114ec large); the
       file's free and used heads are taken on the first load only.
       Later loads relink each new material onto the used list (flag
       0x20 clear) or the free list. Then textures, colours and cycles
       are resolved in index order (MW3: the used list's order).
     - (c1) ported (2026-11-02): `pm/gamez/zimage/zimg_texture`
       (0x531920), `pm/gamez/zmodel/gmod_matl` (0x555e00),
       `pm/gamez/zclass/cls_zbd` (the file list, 0x516ab0, 0x516ae0). A
       later file's texture is its own directory's entry, read from the
       file and found or added by name (0x532450, zimg::add_texture). The
       name is passed from the entry's +0xc with no end of its own, so a
       20-letter one runs on into the state's bytes (kept).
       `test_pm_gamez.py` on PM's exe: the 4 worlds alone, 3 stacks, 4 copies
       cut in the materials and one with 600 materials (every shipped file
       has 1000), alone and stacked, in 5-6-5 and 5-5-5: 34 runs identical.
       7 break tests caught (the file's texture state kept, a mip chain, the
       header taken on every load, no relinking, the last block freed
       downwards, the table's textures for every file, a short read's bytes
       dropped).
     - Models 0x558ba0 (MW3 0x538e30): 0x68 each, appended the same
       way (the free list through +0x64). Each one goes through
       0x5587e0(f, model, material base).
     - (c2) ported (2026-11-02): `pm/gamez/zmodel/gmod_const` (0x558ba0,
       0x5587e0), PM's own types (`pm::zmod::Model`, `Polygon` with its
       material list and UVs per material, `MaterialRef`), blocks of 750
       (0x53fe30 sets the size; the pool starts empty). The reader checks
       no read; a later file's empty slots go on the free list; a slot
       without parents but not all zero is reported (0x606) and read.
       `test_pm_gamez.py`: the models of the 4 worlds, 2 stacks, 4 copies
       cut in the models and a crafted model (light colours with
       fractions, a polygon with two materials each with UVs), alone and
       stacked, both colour formats: 66 runs identical in all. 7 break
       tests caught (no material base, one UV array, a later file's empty
       slots unlinked, the refs' polygons not cumulative, the light
       colours not rounded, the header taken on every load, normals read
       without the flag).
     - **The models' form** (lead's decision (B), 2026-11-02): after each
       model the exe converts it for the renderer. Under Direct3D
       ([0x8c1520], 0x572ae0) a model without 0x80 goes to 0x570b70 (model,
       0x7fffffff, 0x7fffffff): about 1,960 instructions over MSVC
       std::map/set (0x573100..0x576ba0), building triangle strips (0x2000)
       of polygons with UVs and normals. In software, a model with 0x80
       goes back through 0x5726f0. The port keeps the file's form. It is
       exactly PM's under Direct3D for every shipped world: 0x570b70 acts
       only on a model of type 0 with polygons, and every shipped model
       without 0x80 that has polygons is a facade (type 1; 645 in the 4
       worlds), so it returns at once. `test_pm_strips.py` runs PM's own
       0x570b70 on all of them in the emulator (0 changed) and fails if a
       type-0 model ever reaches it. Its other callers run later, on
       models made or copied at run time (0x5587bf with a vertex limit of
       4, 0x510ae2 in cls_clutter's range): to check when those are ported
       (a type-0 model without 0x80 there would be stripped in PM).
     - What reads model polygons for play, in PM: the segment tests
       0x569290, 0x569b00, 0x56a600 (MW3 0x54e2b0, 0x54ea30, 0x54f450:
       the weapons' hits, sight lines, the ground and ray queries), which
       take strips (0x2000) and fans alike; the AI's in/out nets 0x4c9af0
       and 0x4cced0 (new in PM, ZAiNetMechInOut.cpp, "Net without
       color"); cls_clutter 0x512a80 and 0x511b50 (new); model_copy
       0x559340 (MW3 0x5396c0). The rest are drawing (gmod_draw, light,
       puffers, the software path 0x5685c0/0x5689d0). Since the shipped
       form is unchanged under Direct3D, none of them sees a difference.
     - The renderer: it must draw the file's form, as PM's own renderer
       does. That means polygons with a list of materials, UVs per
       material, strips (0x2000) where the file has them, and facades.
       MW3's model draw 0x53f2e0 (2,753 instructions) has no pair in PM:
       PM's draw is new code, to read in step 2. The options for later:
       (i) a PM path in the renderer through the game table; (ii) a
       load-time conversion, ours and outside the ported code, of PM's
       models into the polygons the renderer draws (one per material
       layer, the same vertices, UVs and colours). The lean is (ii), as
       the high-res model layer would use it too. It needs PM's draw
       code read first, for how a polygon's materials combine (blending,
       order).
     - Nodes 0x516e90 / 0x5171a0 (MW3 0x4ff200 / 0x4feaf0), (c3) in
       progress. The pool appends in blocks ([0x60dc68] a block; blocks
       0x6393c8, count 0x6393c0, capacity 0x6393c4); the last block's
       rest is zeroed and freed (0x50c9d0); the live count 0x6393cc is
       reset to 0 on every file (kept). Each node: +0x70, the box index
       (0, 1, 2), becomes a pointer to its box (+0x74, +0x8c, +0xa4);
       the model index plus the model base (0x557ba0); +0x48 cleared;
       0x5171a0(node, f, node base); live flag 0x3000000 in +0xd0. The
       worlds then copy their lights' and sounds' data pointers, as MW3.
       PM's node is its own layout (mech3ax `nodes/node/pm`): the
       parent and child counts are 16 bits each (+0x54, +0x56), the
       arrays at +0x58 and +0x5c, the box centre +0x60, the box index
       +0x70 (MW3: 32-bit counts at +0x54 and +0x5c, arrays at +0x58 and
       +0x60). So the port gets `pm::zcls::Node`, as the models got PM's
       own types. In 0x5171a0 every node index read is offset by the
       node base (cameras' 4 nodes, the world's light, sound and
       partition lists, 0x5178e0 and 0x517960 with 12-byte entries);
       a world partition is 0x58 bytes. Ghidra mangles its switch; the
       jump table (0x5178ac) gives: 0 empty (0x5177e0, the links only), 1
       camera (0x1e8; its 4 nodes; lists 6 and 8; clip 0x506ef0 +0xb0/+0xb4,
       fov 0x507010 +0xd8/+0xdc), 2 world (0xcc, MW3 0xbc: rows +0x9c of
       +0x98 at +0xa0, lights +0xb0/+0xb4/+0xb8, sounds +0xbc/+0xc0/+0xc4,
       +4..+0xc cleared; lists 6 and 13; the fog 0x505600.. and 0x504fb0
       as MW3's), 3 window (0xf8; lists 6, 14), 4 display (0x1c; lists 6,
       15; clear colour 0x50e3c0), 5 object3d (0x90; list 6), 6 lod (0x5c,
       MW3 0x50; list 6), 9 light (0x100, MW3 0xd0: nodes +0xf8/+0xfc;
       lists 6, 9), 10 sound ("Must complete software" reported, then 0x94
       read, +0/+4 cleared, nodes +0x8c/+0x90; lists 6, 10); 7, 8 and
       above 10 report (0x400, line 0x5a6) and give -1. The data classes
       give 1; then the parents (i16 +0x54, into +0x58) and the children
       (i16 +0x56, into +0x5c) through 0x5178e0, each making it 1. A read
       error reports and gives -1 (0x51781d). The same as MW3's
       0x4feaf0 but for the node base, the three sizes, the light's list,
       the 16-bit counts and the partitions' 12-byte entries.
     - (c3) ported (2026-11-02): `pm/gamez/zclass/cls_zbd` read_zbd
       (0x516bc0), open_zbd (0x5179e0), the drop (0x517a70), read_nodes
       (0x516e90), read_node (0x5171a0) and the node lists (0x5178e0,
       0x517960), into the shared types (Shared types, forked logic,
       above), calling MW3's setters (camera clip and fov, the fog, the
       clear colour, the lists, free_node: at the one call the slot is
       already zeroed, as PM's 0x50c9d0 zeroes it). PM sets and clears
       bits 24 and 25 of +0xd0 (MW3: 24); 25's use is unknown. The table's
       `zcls_read_zbd` (MW3 0x4ff520, PM 0x516bc0) takes the interpreter's
       GameZReadZBDFile. `test_pm_gamez.py` (nodes): the 4 worlds, a stack
       and 3 copies cut in the nodes, alone and stacked, both colour
       formats: 22 runs identical, every node, its data, partitions, links
       and the class lists (PM's changed camera setters give the same as
       MW3's on these). 8 break tests caught (no node base in the
       partitions or the links, the counts as int32, the world's tail
       unshifted, the light's colours not skipped, 4-byte partition
       entries, bit 25 not cleared, no model base); bit 25 not set cannot
       show (the files carry it). `mw3pmtests`
       `pm_worlds_stack_through_the_table`: c1 then c2 through the table,
       c2's links and models in c2's part of the pools, versions 27 and 40
       and a bad signature refused with nothing changed (break: version 27
       accepted, caught).
   - **anim.zbd 50: done** (2026-11-03, `pm/gamez/zeffect/zeff_anim_init`,
     the table's `zeff_anim_read_zbd`: MW3 0x50a0e0, PM 0x523140). PM's
     file is read into the shared AnimDef and AnimState in MW3's layout,
     PM's own fields named beside it (`pm_path`, `pm_reset`, `pm_seq2`,
     `pm_block`, `pm_scripts`, the objects' and nodes' `pm_flags` and
     `pm_parent`):
     - The header: signature 0x08170616, version 50, a time stamp, the
       source count (0x54 each, read and dropped). Then a 0x6c block whose
       fields are MW3's block moved (`kFields` in the reader, matched by the
       run-time globals' users).
     - A def is 0x10c bytes (MW3 0x13c). Its node is found by name or by
       a path of names, one under the other (+0x20, count +0x24; none
       shipped). The reset sequence is optional (pointer +0xd0), and one
       more optional sequence follows it (+0xd4; none shipped). The objects
       (0x5c) and nodes (0x2c) carry a parent entry: found under that
       entry's node, else as MW3's lookup.
     - Where MW3 stops the read, PM goes on. A def whose node is missing
       is marked 5, and every node found from it on is cleared (0x524230).
       A puffer that cannot be made leaves the def without puffers.
       Node prerequisites chain children first to last (MW3: last to
       first). The prerequisite FIX (bug)s are MW3's (fixes.md: PM's
       0x376f report drops them all too).
     - PM's scripts (0x1c each, their name, object and data) come after
       the defs, then the messages as MW3's.
     - Through the table as well: PM's node alloc (0x4fc550), active
       switch (0x4fca50) and light (0x50e470, 0x100 bytes).
     - `test_pm_anim.py` on PM's exe: the 4 worlds' anim.zbd against
       their worlds identical (1,601 unported calls traced, every def,
       list, sequence, script and the node pool after); 29 mismatched,
       failing, crafted (a path, parents, a second sequence, a missing
       node and root, a reset left out, one file pointer over a path or
       after a missing node, an anim ref's pointer set) and cut runs
       agree; a cut in the scripts' names refused (the exe reads on
       unchecked). 14 break tests caught (the objects' parent at their
       flags, the nodes' record unshifted, the reset and the second
       sequence not read, the lookup without the path, a missing node's
       clear left out, a missing node or a puffer stopping the read as
       MW3's does, the prerequisite chain cleared, a block field from the
       wrong place, the anim refs' pointer kept, the parent ignored, a
       light unnamed, the lookup sharing from pointer 0).
   - **mechlib 41: done** (2026-11-03, `pm/gamez/zclass/cls_mechlib`, the
     table's `zcls_mechlib_open` and `zcls_mechlib_load`: MW3 0x4fc6d0 and
     0x4fc8f0, PM 0x510910 and 0x510b90). The library object, the
     materials' read (0x510c80), find, close, free and the material
     resolve (0x510770) are MW3's unchanged and stay shared:
     - The open is MW3's with version 41 ([0x60e61c]).
     - A tree (0x5110c0, 0x511210) is read as the world's nodes: the file's
       0xd0 bytes over a new object3d (class 5) or LOD (6, data 0x5c; 2 in
       the file), keeping the new node's data, flag bits 0-1 and list-7
       item (+0xcc); the box index at +0x70 made a pointer. Any other class
       makes the exe dereference null.
     - A model (0x511310, when +0x3c is set) comes from PM's pool
       (0x558f50) in PM's form: vertices, normals and morphs, then
       0x28-byte polygons, each with its vertex indices, normals (flag
       0x1000 and +0xc), its material indices, UVs per material, colours
       only when +0x1c is set. No lights are read; the file's refs are
       read and dropped.
     - The resolve (0x510fd0) makes each index a world material, then sorts
       the model by its polygons' first material (0x55c470, new in PM): a
       cycled material's polygons one ref each, first, then one ref per
       other material in the order first used; one ref keeps the polygons
       in place.
     - Left out: the trace lines to stderr (0x511640) and the renderer
       conversion after the load (0x510ab0 to strips under Direct3D, else
       0x510b00), as for the world's models.
     - Ours, as MW3's: a tree read with its entry's end; a count past it, a
       node of another class, a depth over 64, a polygon with no material,
       or an index past its array, a vertex, normal or library material,
       is refused with a line, nothing added.
     - Shared: the add-child's class 6 (LOD) is the plain link in both exes
       (MW3 0x4eb9b0 through a thunk, PM 0x515bb0); the port had stopped
       there.
     - `test_pm_mechlib.py` on PM's exe: all 76 trees over c1, 23 over c3
       (repeats found, not read), 10 with no world, MW3's file refused, and
       a crafted file over c1 and with no world (a cycled material, a
       polygon with two materials and their UVs, no colours, normals, a LOD
       with a model below it, a model without flag 0x80, box index 3): 6
       runs identical, the library's materials and trees, the texture and
       material tables, every model and node slot. With no world the exe
       adds a cycled library material by copying its cycle from null
       (0x5568f5; the library's have none), so that run's file clears the
       flag.
     - `pm_mechlib_reads_the_shipped_trees_whole` (76 trees, 2 LODs) and
       `pm_mechlib_fuzz_never_crashes` (180 cut, flipped or garbled trees:
       108 refused, 72 read, every cut one refused; what a refused tree
       leaves in the pool is checked whole).
     - The fuzz found the bounded reader's one fault: a broken material count
       drove its UV arrays past 5 GB in 4 s, and a tree marked broken went on
       being read. Now the first break stops it and its model has no counts
       (ours, bounded only; the exe's path is unchanged and still identical).
     - Breaks: 16 caught of 18. MW3's version, the child count at MW3's
       +0x5c, the box pointer, the LOD, colours always, UVs once, refs not
       skipped, normals without +0xc (it took a polygon with flag 0x1000 and
       +0xc 0), the second material, flag bits 0-1, the parent, no sort,
       cycled grouped as others; the fuzz catches the reader's stop before a
       broken count's UVs (over 2 GB) and after a broken polygon. Refs not
       skipped and the parent crash the probe's dump, which counts as caught.
       The alloc's flags 3 by `pm_model_alloc_starts_with_flags_3`: the only
       ported caller replaces the header, so the mechlib test cannot see them;
       `0x558f50` has others (`0x4cefc0`, `0x528120`, `0x528920`, `0x558440`,
       `0x559340`, `0x5b2d10`), to check as they are ported (`0x559340`
       overwrites bits 0-4 from its argument). Not caught, each with its reason:
       the one-ref shortcut (the regroup gives the same order), allocating
       before the check (calloc is lazy on the Mac: no memory seen; kept, as
       MW3's reader does).
     - A model with no polygons and a vertex, normal or morph count past the end
       is refused with no counts left (`pm_mechlib_refused_model_keeps_no_counts`;
       found in review: the check came only inside the polygons' block).
2. **The world**: the light maps and lighting (`gmod_matl.c`; PM drops MW3's
   fog; mapped below), `cls_clutter.cpp` (32 new), the world class
   (`cls_world.c` 20 new), the script interpreter's new commands (the
   dispatcher gained 97 calls).
   - **`gmod_matl.c` mapped** (2026-11-03, from the pseudocode and the asm; no
     port yet). Light maps are a small part of it. Of the file's 113
     functions by the function map, 42 have no MW3 twin (the table above's 39
     counts differently). Sorted by what calls them; the exe's data and code
     searched for pointers too, and no table reaches any of them:
     - **The Direct3D model draw: 18 new, 20 with the shared.** `0x543b10`
       (2,006 lines) does the job of MW3's `0x53f2e0` and has no byte twin.
       `0x53fe30` puts the software draw in the slot `[0xa4e100]`; `0x5400e0`
       replaces it with `0x543b10` when `[0x8c4b70]` is set. That is the
       Direct3D flag: its setter `0x5981d0` is MW3's `0x579210`, which sets
       `[0x72f348]` (render-matrix.md). Its new helpers: the near-plane
       clippers `0x549440`, `0x549630`, `0x549ab0`, `0x54a450`, `0x54a6f0`,
       `0x54aa50` (the shape of render-clip3d.md's six), `0x552e50` through
       six one-line wrappers (`0x54ade0`..`0x54ae80`), and `0x542a70`,
       `0x5439e0`, `0x54faa0`, `0x54fc60` (not read yet). To port.
     - **The software draw: 8 new, out** (the software path is not ported,
       CLAUDE.md). `0x541a40` is the twin of MW3's `0x53e050`, and only it
       reaches these. No pointer to any of them is in the exe's data or code,
       and no other caller. Each one against the rule that what only software
       showed comes to the GPU:
       - `0x548f50`, `0x5490e0`, `0x549290`, `0x549f30`: near-plane clippers
         of software's vertex buffers. Show nothing of their own; the Direct3D
         ones above do the job.
       - `0x54a3b0`, `0x54a3d0`, `0x54a3f0`: one-line wrappers of `0x5502d0`.
         Nothing of their own.
       - `0x5502d0`: the side-plane clipper, `0x552e50`'s software twin (1,161
         lines to 1,134, no calls out, 26 globals shared; the others are each
         one's vertex buffers). Compared by shape, not line by line. Nothing
         flagged.
       - `[0x6112e4]`, read only by `0x541a40`: not a software feature. The
         graphics options' detail level (`0x40b120`, MW3's `0x40d310`) clears
         it at the lowest level, and the software draw then skips work. It
         hides; it adds nothing to bring over.
       None is flagged. **Open until the draw `0x543b10` is ported:** `0x5502d0`
       and `0x541a40` are good evidence, not proof. `0x541a40`'s own 622 lines
       were read only where these globals are used. Compare both with what the
       Direct3D draw does then, since what only software showed comes to the
       GPU. Two more new functions are reached from both draws, so they stay in.
     - **The other 14.**
       - Setters and start-up, ported with the helpers that first read them:
         `0x5404f0` (`[0xa4e038]`, read by both draws), `0x540740`, `0x556420`
         (resets the draw state from `0x5400e0`). `0x541a30`: the setter of
         `[0x6112e4]` above; a stored value only, kept for `0x40b120`.
       - The loader's: `0x557be0` (the model pool's growth, done), `0x557ba0`
         (index to model, done), `0x557b30` (model to index, not ported; with
         its caller `0x515fb0`).
       - `0x546d50`, `0x5470a0`, `0x5473f0`, `0x547740`: the view-plane test
         `0x546a00` (MW3's `0x541760`) in other plane orders, swapped into
         `PTR_FUN_00611354`, which the scene walk calls (`0x5079a0`..). Not the
         light map's; they go with the world class.
       - `0x5415b0`, `0x543010`, `0x5432b0`: no caller, no pointer in code or
         data. Dead; not ported.
     - **The light map itself.** `[0x683cb0]` holds one texture. The script's
       `LightMapTexture` (`0x5b2d10`) sets it through `0x532450`, and
       `0x530810` clears it. The draw adds it to a polygon as one more shadow
       set, of kind 2 (the set with xyz): set's texture from the entry's +8.
       `0x4aefe0` changes the video mode (`0x4399f0`, `0x483700`, `0x484ed0`..):
       it keeps the texture's name, frees the texture, clears `[0x683cb0]` and
       finds it again after, as a mode change loses surfaces. `0x5995a0` (zvid_dd)
       marks that texture's surface as it is made. The draw uses the light map
       only when it is set, the option's `[0x8ccc64]` is not -1, and the device
       can: `0x59b8a0` reads the last fields of the D3D device description at
       `0xb0a074` (size `0xfc`), `[0x8ccc68]` being `wMaxSimultaneousTextures` and
       `[0x8ccc6c]` `wMaxTextureBlendStages`, both 0 unless `dwTextureOpCaps` has
       MODULATE, and both needing at least 2. The GPU path always has two
       textures to give, so that gate becomes true there.
     - **The option.** `LIGHT MAPS` is a graphics option: `0x43a060` offers
       `LIGHT MAPS` (3), `LIGHT MAPS A` (1), `LIGHT MAPS B` (2). `0x40b270`
       keeps a settings value and sets `[0x8ccc64]` from its bits 17 and 18:
       neither 0, bit 17 alone 1, bit 18 alone 2, both -1 (the draw's "no light
       map"); it leaves `[0x8ccc64]` alone when the value is 0. Bit 4 turns
       the `sunlight` node on or off.
     - **Shipped use.** Scripts and text data are stored plain, so a raw search
       of every installed file covers them: `interp.zbd` has `LightMapTexture`
       4 times, all naming `lightmap`. `LightSetLightMap`, `LightSetBicolored`,
       `LightSetAmbientColor`, `LightSetDiffuseColor` and
       `NodeSetOverrideAmbient/Diffuse` are in the exe alone: they wait for
       the interpreter's item.
     - **`LightMapTexture`: ported** (2026-11-03). The word through the shared
       dispatcher behind the game table's `zint_light_map_texture`, null in
       MW3's, so there it stays an unknown word; `pm/gamez/zimage/zimg_texture`
       holds `[0x683cb0]` and PM's free `0x530810`. It matches the whole word,
       unlike most commands (`LightMapTextureX` is a miss). With no argument
       it calls the add with null, whose real `0x532450` would crash on
       `strrchr`; the test's stand-in hides that, and no shipped line does it.
       `test_pm_light_map.py` on PM's exe: 8 lines identical (the light map,
       the cursor, the misses, the names). Breaks, 5 of 5: prefix match, not
       stored, argument not taken (the differential); MW3 knowing the word,
       the free keeping it (`pm_light_map_texture_is_pms_alone`).
     - **The near clippers: ported** (2026-11-03, `pm/gamez/zmodel/gmod_clip3d`):
       `0x549440`, `0x549630`, `0x549ab0`, `0x54a450`, `0x54a6f0`, `0x54aa50`
       with their carriers `0x54fea0` and `0x550100`, one loop and a mask of
       what each carries. The carriers' bits 1, 2 and bare 8 are the software
       clippers', not ported. Against MW3's six (render-clip3d.md): cdecl, not
       fastcall; no far reject and no plane mask, as the draw only calls them
       for a polygon its cull marked; a polygon that grew moves to arenas
       (`[0xa4cfac]`.., sized per model in the port: a polygon that grows is written whole, near plane and
       sides each, so n + 1 and n + 5 of room; 8 a polygon overran the heap, seen as Windows' 0xC0000374, 2026-11-06),
       not fixed buffers; and **the point light is
       interpolated at a cut**, MW3's copied from the edge's first vertex.
       FIX (bug): the exe's scratch and shadow sets hold 64 vertices, unchecked,
       while PM's polygons allow 1,023 and shipped ones reach 313 (139 over 32 in
       c1, c3 and c4; mechlib's reach 52). The scratch holds the most a cut can
       make, 1.5n, and the shadow sets grow. The near
       value `[0x8d4b14]` comes from the view (`0x548990`, MW3's `0x526e10`, the
       shared `near_z`): it and the arenas' start (`0x543b10`) go with the draw.
       `test_pm_clip3d.py` on PM's exe at 24-bit x87: 9,000 polygons by default,
       every buffer, the result, the count and what moved, up to 64 vertices;
       past that the port alone (`pm_clip3d_keeps_the_largest_polygon_whole`).
       NaNs may differ in
       sign, and cases with extreme inputs in value (the x87 keeps a 15-bit
       exponent in its registers), as MW3's test allows. Breaks, 19 of 20. Not
       caught: a set without xyz carrying xyz at a cut, which only reaches the
       scratch (write-back checks the kind), so nothing can see it.
     - **The plane tests and vertex colours: ported** (2026-11-03,
       `pm/gamez/zmodel/gmod_cull`): `0x54faa0` (each vertex's plane code),
       `0x54fc60` (a polygon's), `0x5439e0` (each TL vertex's colour, with the
       fade's alpha), `0x5403d0` (the fade). Plane 8 never rejects a polygon:
       its count is not reset and runs on from before (kept). The colours use
       the 1.5 * 2^52 trick: as a 53-bit FPU gives it with `fpu53` (play), and
       the 24-bit result without, where the sum keeps multiples of 2^29, so it
       is 0 unless a value is huge. `test_pm_cull.py` on PM's exe: 4,000 of each,
       the colours at both precisions. Breaks, 16 of 16.
     - **The side clipper: ported** (2026-11-03, `gmod_clip3d`, `clip2d`):
       `0x552e50` with its wrappers `0x54ade0`..`0x54ae80`, which differ only by
       the mask (`0x54ae60` and `0x54ae80` are the same). Its polygon's codes
       (+0x34) pick the passes, left, right, top, bottom, a pass reading one
       scratch set and writing the other. Values go perspective-correct by rhw.
       A NaN is outside left and top, inside right and bottom. A set's overrun
       is the near clippers' FIX (bug): room for four passes at 1.5n.
       `test_pm_clip2d.py` on PM's exe at 24-bit x87: 7,500 polygons. As well as
       the near test's tolerances, a case with extreme inputs may end with
       another vertex count (2 in 7,500). Past 64 vertices the port alone,
       `pm_clip2d_keeps_large_polygons_whole`. Breaks, 22 of 22.
     - **Do polygons past 64 reach the clippers?** No. All 27 past 64 in the four worlds' models
       (c1 8 nodes of 313, 198 and 113 corners, `g5351`..; c2 6 of 189, `g2012`..; c3 6 of 231,
       `g5380`..; c4 5 of 104, `g6114`..; plain polygons, flat at y = 0, each under `inout`/`inoutmN`)
       are the `inout` boundary areas, which PM deletes at mission load as MW3 does (`0x4cddb0`,
       MW3's `0x4c3930`, render.md 6a): never drawn. Outside `inout` the largest is 64, and all 19
       of 49 to 64 corners are strips (`g3860`, c1), which `split_strips` makes triangles before a
       clipper sees them when they need clipping, and which otherwise draw whole, unclipped.
       Counted 2026-11-04 with concavity (turn signs about the summed normal): outside `inout`, the largest non-strip
       polygon is 16 corners (`healthy`, c3 and c4, concave); c1 and c2 reach 15 (`veh_hulk`). Concave ones are few
       (1 to 7 a world, sizes 8, 12, 16). Mechlib: 15 and, concave, 13. Random clips of the concave ones (a Python
       copy of the clip's rule, five planes, 30,000 tries a polygon): 16 grew to 19. That is measured, not a proof: a
       concave polygon can gain up to half its corners a plane, 121 for 16 over five planes in theory, past the
       exe's 64-vertex set; the port's sets grow as needed (fixes.md), so it holds either way.
       The largest plain polygon that draws has at most 48. Corrected 2026-11-04: an earlier note
       here feared a 64-corner polygon near-cut to 65. On the exe's clippers in the emulator a
       65th vertex does fault (the two textured paths, a pointer overwritten at 0x6887d0; the other
       four write past the scratch silently), but no shipped data reaches them with one. The fix
       stays as a guard.
     - **For the zones (the lead, from W58, not on main yet):** in MW3 an AI
       mech's ski and collision queries honour the zones in the camera's view,
       so a lancemate in another zone loses the floor under him (0x476a30, zone
       mode on from 0x49e82b; 0x4161f6 and 0x4c33ff turn it off). Fixed in Skis
       and `Mech::collide_query` behind bugs. Check PM's twins of those two calls
       when PM's zones are reached, and tell the lead if PM differs.
       **Checked after main's merge (2026-11-04), from the code:** PM keeps the same zone switch, MW3's
       `[0x5ea1d0]` at PM's `[0x60d5e8]`: set on in the player's setup (0x4a19c0, MW3 0x49e810), saved, cleared
       and put back in the twins of MW3's places (0x416c70, 0x4cd2f0, 0x4519e7, 0x49477c, 0x50a8cb..0x50ab43),
       read by the zone test (0x55d160, 0x55d1e0, 0x55d270). So the lancemate's lost floor is PM's too, and W58's
       fix in the shared `Skis::update` and `Mech::collide_query` applies the same way (behind bugs, AI mechs).
       What W58's grid assumes that PM changes: (1) the ground and segment queries it builds from (PM's
       0x5003a0, 0x502360) also visit a cell's clutter records, which the port's `cls_di` skips on PM (see the
       mission load's note), so the grid sees no props; (2) the boundary: PM's `inout` loader (0x4cddb0, MW3
       0x4c3930) has its own area container (0xc0-byte areas), counts standalone missions (type 5, by 0x435db0)
       and training; the area is selected by 0x4ce290, a listener slot (not "while it loads": corrected
       2026-11-04, step 5). The port's `inout` is still MW3's, so on PM a standalone mission has no boundary and
       the grid none to keep to. The `inout` loader is the AI step's first item; the clutter queries go with
       collision. W58 is off for enemies and multiplayer anyway.
     - **The draw, piece 1: the type dispatch ported** (2026-11-03,
       `pm/gamez/zmodel/gmod_draw`): `0x542a70` and `0x5416e0` (the facade's centre,
       MW3's `0x53dcf0` on PM's polygons). Type 0 the model-view, 1 a facade, 2
       points, drawn here to `zmod::DrawTable`'s point, the same seam as MW3's.
       The facade's turn is MW3's own, split out as `zmod::facade_turn`. Counted on
       all four worlds and mechlib: types 0 and 1 only, no points, no flag 0x40 or
       flag 8. Facade modes 0 and 1 in the worlds; **mechlib ships a mode 2**,
       `g4` in `headlight.flt`, the headlight's beam. Mode 3 ships nowhere. Modes 2
       and 3 (`0x538e40`, `0x539200`; MW3's `0x51f390`, `0x51f750`) are one shared
       version in `facade_turn`, which MW3 gains too with no effect on its data:
       its callees are twins, and PM's quaternion product `0x53ef90` differs from
       MW3's `0x5255d0` only in the order of its sums. FIX (bug): points with
       no vertices or no polygons draw nothing (the exe loops 2^32 times, or reads
       through null; `pm_points_without_polygons`). `test_pm_modeldraw.py`, importing
       `modeldraw_common.py`, on PM's exe with c1 and c3: 3,000 draws, the result,
       the default flag, the stack's top and the one below, the points and the
       camera-space vertices, editing the data for what shipped data lacks. Points
       past a shorter morph list are the last draw's, on both sides, so the test
       morphs them all. The stack's depth after the call is compared, since type 2
       pops the draw's push. The centre is compared bit for bit, and about 93% of
       the matrix floats are bit-identical. One exception: a sphere facade whose
       two vectors are nearly opposite, where the turn comes from their small sum
       and its rounding grows to 2^-23 / |sum|; the test allows exactly that and
       lists the cases (2 in 3,000, allowing 0.004 and 0.009, worst seen 0.0054).
       Breaks, 14 of 14. Emulator only.
     - **Phase 3: the draw up to its first lighting call** (`begin_model`,
       `build_records`, `lights_reaching`; `test_pm_records.py`). The exe's draw runs
       whole with a hook at the end of each ref's build (0x54471c), which compares
       what it built and skips the rest. The needs (fog from `[0xa4e038]`, where 2
       fogs every model, not only flagged ones; lights; tint), camera space with
       morphs, plane codes, normals, the gates; per polygon the back-face test, its
       flip with flag 0x400, polygon codes, fog factors and flags 8, 0x20, an
       all-fog polygon dropped, UVs, colours, normals, the extra UV sets, strips. PM's
       normal is (p2 - p1) x (p0 - p1), MW3's the other way, each with its own test.
       Not reached by this test: the lights' part of the needs, the bake's call, the
       model's own lights (0x547dd0). They come with phase 4.
       Shipped counts, for the arenas: largest model 500 vertices (mechlib; 351 in a
       world), 64 morphs, 420 polygons, 120 polygons in a ref, no polygon with extra
       materials (all four worlds and mechlib's 76 trees).
     - **Phase 4a: the polygon lighting** (`lights_reaching` 0x55ebf0, `sort_lights`
       0x5602e0, `shade_polygon` 0x5603f0, `light_records`; `test_pm_lighting.py`).
       Lights are made in the test, every kind and flag, with clouds and the bake's
       results. PM's lights have their own colours (flag 0x400, PM +0xb0..+0xdf), 0x200
       means already in the bake, 0x20 means the light is fog rather than colour.
       Left: the projected lights' test 0x562620.
     - **Phase 4b: the model's lights** (`draw_model_lights`, 0x547dd0;
       `test_pm_model_lights.py`). No shipped world model has any, so they are made in
       the test. The exe batches its opaque points; the port draws each as it comes.
       The test compares order within the points only. **Eye check, phase 6:** points
       meeting blended polygons, since draw order could change the result. The flare
       hook (0x588910) is still to wire to `flare_add`, and that mapping is unchecked.
     - **Phase 4c: the bake** (`bake_static_light`, 0x55fb30; `test_pm_bake.py`, and
       `test_pm_lighting.py` with the real bake feeding it). As MW3's: a spot's first
       vertex reads the light-to-vertex vector left from the last one, which the exe
       has on its stack, and below near^2 the range is tested with the squared distance.
       **Known gap:** with vertex shading off the exe's bake reads the last draw's
       normals; that path is not tested with the real bake.
     - **Phases 4d and 4e: strips and fans into triangles, the sets** (`split_strips`,
       `split_fans`, `shadow_sets`, `light_map_sets`; `test_pm_sets.py`, to the end of
       the sets at 0x54600e). Casters and lights are made in the test, up to all seven
       sets on a polygon. PM keeps a caster's texture at +0x64, MW3 at +0x60: the
       caster's own port must place it. A light map set: UVs in the square across the
       light's range, colour the light's PM +0xd4 by the vertex colour, fade at
       +0x153c from (far - d) * 255. The fade is the 1.5 * 2^52 rounding, so at 24 bits
       it is only ever 0 or full; c3 runs at 53 bits to reach the values between.
       `light_map_sets` goes through `fpu53`, so the shipped default has the real fade.
       **Open, for Owen's PC:** what the original shows, at the runtime's precision, and
       on the three-stage path, which reads as losing the fade.
       **Traced, mirrored UVs at 53 bits:** a polygon whose camera-space normal has x
       exactly 0 takes 0x5381c0's first branch, axis (1, 0, 0) at full length. With x
       tiny, the other branch gives (y, -x, 0) / approx_sqrt(x^2 + y^2): for y < 0 that
       is about (-1, 0, 0), and its approximate root scales it. In the case traced
       the exe had x = -3.03e-9 and the port, in floats, 0: u and v negated, length
       0.946. So the map turns 180 degrees and changes size by that factor. The shipped
       map is a round soft spot: the turn alone moves it by at most 9/255 (mean 2), with
       the size at most 33/255 (mean 11), in its soft ring.
       **Decided (the lead, 2026-11-04):** the port stays; it matches the exe at 24 bits
       and the scale is the original's own approximate root, which already leaves such
       steps between polygons. `test_pm_sets.py` compares these UVs at 53 bits and allows
       only this case, exe x under 1e-7 and ours exactly 0, with the exe's UVs ours turned
       and scaled by its own factor; it prints how many. **Eye check, phase 6:** an
       axis-aligned wall under a yaw-aligned camera with a light map on it, for a seam
       between neighbouring polygons: random cameras say nothing about how often in play.
       The test maps a zero page, for a strip's missing normal and the bench's null
       texture images. Every null read on the exe's side then succeeds, so a passing
       run does not show those two are the only null reads in this path.
       The draw's fade and shadow flag are the shared `DrawState`'s, as the walk
       sets them; `cull_state().fade` must follow it before `tl_colours` (phase 6).
     - **Phase 4f: the projected lights** (`gmod_projected`, 0x562620, 0x562840, 0x561fb0,
       0x562120; `test_pm_projected.py`, on records made in the test). MW3's 0x547740
       rewritten: the split's threshold is a fifth of the nearest light's far squared, at
       least 30; PM's own colours (flag 0x400); light map colours carried. A slip: the
       test on a set's kind starts one set late, so a first set that is a light map keeps
       old colours at a polygon's centre and splits (FIX (bug), behind `zfix bugs`; the
       probe keeps the original's path). Left, for the casters' port: `shadow_model` and
       `shadow_model_morphed` read `node->model`, so a PM node casts no shadow image and
       takes no morph there; safe, and to route with PM's caster (texture at +0x64).
       **PM draws no projected shadows until the caster's port:** do not read their
       absence as a phase 6 bug in the eye check.
       **Traced, a tie between edges:** a split takes the triangle's longest edge. A
       midpoint split leaves two edges equal in exact arithmetic; rounding makes one
       longer, not always the same one here and in the exe (968.056571 against 968.056552
       in the exe, 968.056335 against 968.056396 here, in the case traced at polygon 3021).
       The split falls on the other edge: another triangulation of the same polygon. On
       7 in 30,000 random polygons, all at 53 bits since the sums and factors follow
       PM's order: mean difference at most 0.95 of 255, worst 38.9, on 6.3% of an equilateral
       triangle (a three-way tie) under a short light whose pool is sharp. The original can
       flip the same way as the camera moves. `test_pm_projected.py` allows only a
       near tie the exe's own split saw, and only if the picture agrees; it prints how
       many. **Eye check, phase 6:** a projected light over a light-mapped polygon, bugs
       on and off (the first set's colours), and any shimmer at a short light's pool.
     - **Phases 5 and 6, to the device calls** (`draw_model`, `clip_near`, `project_records`,
       `clip_sides`, `fill_colours`, `finish_tl`, `submit`; `test_pm_submit.py`). The whole of
       0x543b10 runs against its device stubs: every call in order, kind, count, cull, primitive,
       shade and overlay, its TL vertices and its sets. Polygons drawn apart (a fade, an overlay,
       a strip, an alpha texture, sets) call one at a time; the rest of a ref go together as one
       indexed triangle list, always primitive 4 (0x5a0ea0, 0x5a0f30 push it themselves, and
       ignore 0x8c4c40). The device kinds take different arguments: flat (colour, alpha, count,
       overlay), lit (alpha, count, overlay), textured kinds (count, texture, fade, overlay).
       A flat polygon's u, v are whatever its arena held, and no texture reads them: not compared.
       Whole draws run under projected lights at 24 bits, on models under 120 units with at most 16
       corners (the split's 2,048 triangles); at 53 a tie falls either way (`test_pm_projected.py`).
       **Facing, bit for bit:** at the exe's own test, its inputs go to the port's `face`, and the
       sum and normal must match exactly at both precisions. It found the sum's order wrong in the
       port ((z+y)+x; the exe (x+y)+z), which a polygon-level compare hid, since it flips a polygon
       only on a tie. The exe stores e0x and e0y; the rest stay on the x87's stack, so double at 53.
       **Large polygons.** Every drawn node is compared, with every plane mask, in all four worlds
       (c1, c2 at 24 bits, c3, c4 at 53); only the 27 `inout` polygons past 64 corners are left out,
       which never draw (below). The 49 to 64 ones are strips, so nothing clips them whole.
       Two allowances, both at 53 bits only, both counted in the test's last line. **A flat mesh
       edge-on:** with the camera in its plane, facing is the rounding of a sum near 0 and the
       polygons passing differ (the exe's sums are double, ours float); allowed only when every
       triangle of both call lists covers under 0.05 square pixels. **A side cut:** a vertex a
       screen side made, on an edge reaching far off screen; the exe interpolates in double and
       we in float, under 1 pixel (largest seen 0.293). Counted only when the plain compare refuses
       the vertex. At 24 bits neither fires. Not chased (the lead, 2026-11-04): play-accurate, and
       the port's float is the same step at 24 bits. One exception at either precision: **a near
       cut under sets**, 0x54a6f0, leaves its fog to the arena (fixes.md), so the fog word of a
       polygon with a corner on the near plane is not compared there.
     - **The device side** (`pm/gamez/zvideo/zvid_tl`, the shared flushes; `test_pm_device.py`).
       The exe's 0x59d450, 0x59de30, 0x59e500, 0x59e830, 0x59eb60, 0x5a0060, 0x5a0390, 0x5a0f30,
       0x5a0ea0 and flushes 0x59f550, 0x59f9e0 run against a Direct3D stub that keeps the state
       its calls leave; every draw is compared with what Render3D gets, in order: primitive,
       state, vertex bytes, and each fog colour. They are MW3's draws with the vertices ready,
       and these differences:
       - **A queue entry carries more** (0x24 bytes to MW3's 0x10): the fog colour when it was
         queued, restored at the flush before it draws if it changed (0x59f78c), and an **additive**
         flag, count's bit 31, from the image's +0x0c bit 2 (0x59e7c8), which makes the flush send
         DESTBLEND ONE for that entry (0x59f76d: `(~count >> 31) << 2 | 2`) and 6 again after.
         No texture in the four worlds has that bit at load (0 of 437, 396, 362, 400); mech and
         interface textures not counted, and nothing found that sets it at run time. So the
         additive path is checked against the exe but is not in the eye-check shots.
       - **Limits:** overlay 3,000 polygons to MW3's 384 (`OverlayList::limit`, set by PM's
         start); queue 3,000 and 12,000 vertices to MW3's 6,000 and 24,000 (the port keeps the
         larger: more room, no report).
       - **Lit untextured below full alpha draws nothing** (0x59de38 `jl` to the return), where
         MW3's 0x57c700 queued it: fixes.md, candidates.
       - **Sets:** the polygon, then each set with its own u, v over the shared TL; kind 1 multiplied
         (ZERO, SRCCOLOR, clamped, SELECTARG1, no fog), kind 0 blended (wrap, MODULATE, fog). Kind 2,
         the light map, comes with its shader and is skipped until then.
       - **Strips** draw with CULLMODE CW (0x59b870) and only they do. FIX (A): culled here, per
         triangle, and handed over as a list, so no backend's winding can decide it. The stub cannot
         say which way CW cuts (the test uses the same formula as the port); that is by eye: the
         other sign loses most of the terrain (`c1`).
       Render3D gained `additive` (pipeline state: one more bit in the key, so no existing draw
       changes pipeline; no shader changed) and `Primitive::kTriangles`. MW3 is untouched:
       `--fly c1` and `c3` shots byte-identical before and after, `test_drawtable`, `test_shadows`,
       `test_shadow_image`, `test_puffers` pass. Overlays over 64 corners go on as fans (FIX bug;
       the exe overruns); not compared. Points still take MW3's `draw_point`; PM's 0x59ee90 batches
       them (0x59f8a0): not ported yet, an eye-check item. `draw_unlit` is gone.
       **The view: who sets it (closed 2026-11-04).** PM's `0x548990` and `0x53b730` read as MW3's
       `0x526e10` and `0x521c60`, field for field: camera +0xb0 near, +0xb4 far, the window's origin
       and size (or the screen's), `0x53b730(x, y, w/2, h/2, +0x1d4, +0x1d8, near, far)`; cx, cy =
       origin + half; fx, fy = cot * half / near; the slopes [0x8d43a4], [0x8d43a8] are the two cots;
       under Direct3D the clip rect is x, y, x + w + 0.001, y + h + 0.001 ([0x5e2b60] is +0.001), the
       points' rect x + w - 0.001. So the shared setter (`gmod_init`, camera +0x1d4 at the same
       place) is PM's, and `draw_pm_model` copies its rect rather than working one out. The debug
       start's stubs do not feed it but for the far clip's value.
       **Which way CW cuts.** 0x5467a6 pushes 2 to 0x59b870, SetRenderState(22, ..): CULLMODE
       D3DCULL_CW, which drops triangles running clockwise on screen, screen y running down (a
       positive cross product); a strip's odd triangles count reversed. `draw` here keeps the rest.
       Screen y grows with camera y (fy positive), and the exe's facing test keeps d < 0 on the same
       points; `test_pm_device.py`'s `winding_agrees` checks the two keep the same triangles.
     - **The 24-bit audit (2026-11-04).** Each draw test forced to 24 bits (`PM_24=1` for those with
       a 53-bit half), every field by distance in float steps. Bit for bit now, and held there
       (tolerance 0 at 24 bits): `test_pm_bake`, `test_pm_model_lights`, `test_pm_lighting`'s colours and
       lit values, `test_pm_sets`' positions, set u, v and colours and the records' other words,
       `test_pm_projected` whole, `test_pm_submit`'s vertices and sets. What moved them: PM's compiler sums
       three terms as (x + y) + z, and the port had (z + y) + x in `face`, `dot`, the light's distance (point,
       spot, bake, reach) and the light map's along, u, v. Breaks catch the facing sum, `dot`, the point and
       spot distances, along and v. The rest are read from the asm or by pattern: the bake's sum and u (asm;
       u's axis has a zero term, so no test can tell), the reach distance (0x537a50's sum not read to its
       end, the same compiler; it only meets a range compare).
       Not bit for bit, with the reason:
       - **Fog factors** (`test_pm_lighting`'s fog 62 to 96% exact on fogged polygons, the +0x10 word in
         `test_pm_sets`, the records' `data`; off by up to 3,424 steps on a value of 0.00096): shared
         `fog_vertices` keeps double, as the x87 does at 53 bits in play, and the exe's steps round at 24.
         Tried: float steps at 24 bits made every plain fogged polygon exact (the rest went exact after the
         order fixes), so that is the whole cause. Not kept: MW3's `test_fogsort` runs the original at
         extended precision, and a test-only branch in code MW3 ships is not worth it. The fog fields keep
         tolerance 2e-4; the specular byte may be 1 off.
       - **The facade's models** (`test_pm_records` positions 75 to 94% exact, `test_pm_modeldraw` 97.4%
         overall): shared `facade_turn` and its trig. **Not traced further**; its order and the x87's
         asin against the port's are the suspects. Worst 2e-4 relative, as before. Tolerance stays.
       - `test_pm_records`' other kinds lose 0.01 to 0.13% of positions, near zero or at most 128 steps:
         **unexplained**. The same draws in `test_pm_sets` and `test_pm_submit` are exact, so my guess is
         a facade left on a node between draws; not checked.
       `project_d3d` and `unproject_d3d`: not on PM's path. `src/pm` calls neither; it has `project_point`,
       `project_records` and `gmod_projected`'s local unprojection, each in PM's order. Their users are
       MW3's draws (`gamez/zmodel/gmod_draw`, `gmod_light`).
     - **The light map's shader** (`Render3D::draw_light_map`, `sdl_render3d`'s `vs_light_map`,
       `fs_light_map` in MSL, HLSL and GLSL; `light_map` in `zvid_tl`). 0x5a03b0's two-stage path:
       src = texture * map * colour, alpha = the texture's * the colour's (the fade), the map's alpha
       unused, the map clamped; blended SRCALPHA, ONE; fog on, with FOGCOLOR black around the draw, so
       fog dims what is added. A vertex is 0x28 bytes; in the buffer it takes two `TLVertex` slots, the
       pitch doubled, so nothing else about the buffer or its upload changes. One more pipeline key
       bit. `test_pm_device.py` compares the vertices, states and fog sends with the exe's two-stage
       path (option 2), and half its steps run at 53 bits for the colours. `mw3sdltests`'
       `sdl_render_draws_a_light_map` checks the pixels: added, faded, fogged, clamped.
       **Checked:** all three languages compile (GLSL with glslangValidator, HLSL with `dxc` on the PC, by the
       lead); only MSL has run. HLSL and GLSL have run nowhere: `sdl_render_draws_a_light_map` joins the
       Windows and Linux checks when those builds next run. A driver refusing these two shaders costs only
       the pools of light (one log line); `ok_` does not depend on them, so MW3 cannot lose its renderer to them.
       **The polygon's u, v under a light map (quirk):** 0x5a04bb keeps them only when the last set is
       a light map and the first is not; otherwise the sets before leave theirs in the vertices.
       **All three "on" settings take this formula** (`fixes.md`). The three-stage path (option 1, or
       auto when the device has 3 stages) is read from the code only: stage 2 modulates the colour
       by the diffuse but its alpha takes no diffuse, so it loses the fade. **Open, for Owen's PC:**
       what the original shows there.
       No world shows a light map yet: `LightSetLightMap` waits for the interpreter's item. To see one,
       `mw3pm --fly c1 --look 0 20 --map-light 2432 5 -2300 120` (debug only).
     - **`cls_clutter`: mapped; the settings ported** (`pm/gamez/zclass/cls_clutter`, 0x513030, 0x513310,
       0x513990; `test_pm_clutter.py`: the 64 shipped templates of the four worlds and crafted entries, each
       with every third named node missing, every field and node flag). The anim lookup (0x524b50) and a
       substitute's hit callbacks (0x5a4d80, 0x5a4dc0; 0x513c60, 0x513cf0) are hooks so far. The templates'
       nodes too (0x5139d0, 0x511ad0, 0x511b50): each world's script-named templates give 2 or 3 textures and
       20 to 23 pieces, and crafted scenes reach what shipped data does not (pieces off their plane, u and v
       outside 0..1, models that are not one textured polygon, a child that does not project). The laying too
       (0x513a30, 0x512d90, 0x512d20, 0x512c60, 0x512c00, 0x512bb0, 0x512a80, 0x512000, 0x505e10): on the four
       worlds with their templates 13,090, 1,750, 6,485 and 4,263 records in the cells, the rand sequence in step,
       every field bit for bit but the rotated turns (x87 `fsin`/`fcos`: 7,775 of 7,893 words identical, worst
       1.2e-7; 222,399 words of aligned records, no trig, all exact). A mission's load turns the ground test off first (0x5116a0(1), 0x492f9a; c2 then lays 2,129 records, compared
       too), so the made-up ground of the other runs (0x4ff8d0, hooked) only tests that branch, which the load does
       not take. The cell's box (0x5043d0) is a hook until the world class lands. Records live in
       `Partition::pm_clutter`, and nothing draws them yet.
       A crafted world reaches what shipped data does not: zones, moved objects, LoDs, inactive nodes, cells
       past the grid, a second material. The crater 0x513d90 is ported and compared at records' places and past the
       world's corners (0x505230 keeps a point inside the area; the decompile does not show it, the assembly does).
       The free 0x513a40 is ported, untested: `clutter_free`; the cells' records go with the world, which frees
       them when its class lands. The hits are ported (0x513c60, 0x513cf0; made-up records, 4,000 calls,
       `clutter_on_weapon_hit`, `clutter_on_collide`), wired in `wire_weapons`: the record is the hit's owner
       (+0x28). `anim_find` and `anim_start` went unset until 2026-11-06, so a piece hit just vanished. Both take OnWeaponHit's anim
       and model; no code in the file reads OnCollide's or OnCrater's anim and model. The draw is ported (0x50a1e0,
       0x50a230, 0x50a3e0, the tree 0x504450, 0x5045e0, 0x504530, 0x504640, 0x5047e0, the corners 0x53c510), called
       from the walk's cell (`zgame::Table::cell_clutter`, wrapped cells too). A cell over 20 records gets its tree
       when drawn, at most one cell a walk (0x509dd0's local), so a cell draws flat until a frame reaches it first.
       `test_pm_clutter.py` lays the worlds, craters them, then compares frames against the exe, some at the crater
       and some where a record's fade is nearly out: every draw in order, matrix and fade, and every tree built. Not
       observable there: the tree's own cull and fade skips only repeat what each record's checks decide, so breaking
       them changes no draw. The gate [0x60d968] is not ported: 1 in the exe's data, and nothing writes it.
       `mw3pm --fly` loads it as a mission does (no ground test): rocks and small props on the ground in
       `--fly c2 --pos 1536 40 -1792 --look 0 15` and `--fly c3 --pos 1792 25 -896 --look 180 5`; no original compared.
       The world's update (0x504a40) drops the tree and takes in records' flag 4; below. The rest is not ported
       (0x5106b0..0x514b90, 65 functions, ~3,500 lines of pseudocode). Scattered props laid on the ground by its material. **It waits for the interpreter
       and the mission load**: its template names come from the script command `AddClutterTemplates`
       (0x512fd0, from 0x5b2e15, a list at [0x639c14]). The load (0x492f8c.., unless `-noclutter`,
       [0x62cc58]; "Loading Clutter"): 0x5116a0(1) turns it on; 0x513030(0x609980) reads the settings
       file named there, one record of 0x88 bytes per entry: `scale_range`, `translate_uv_range`,
       `far_fade_range`, `rotation_range` (degrees), `min_slope`, `max_slope` (cosines), `OnWeaponHit`,
       `OnCrater`, `OnCollide` (each `health`, an effect, a `model`), `align_normal`, `substitute`
       (weighted nodes, flagged 0x200000 and made inert) by 0x513310; 0x5139d0 finds each template node
       by name (0x50b920) and 0x511ad0 walks it to single-polygon textured models; 0x511b50 projects
       its children onto that polygon (0x568d00) for u, v in 0..1 (the "does not project to polygon" report),
       kept per material in a map at [0x639be4]; 0x513a30 -> 0x512d90 walks the world's grid and each
       node's tree (0x512d20, flag 4, not 0x4000000) and for each polygon of a type-0 model with
       textures (0x512bb0, not 0x800) lays that material's templates over each triangle: 0x512a80, a strip
       or a fan, the same triangle rule as `split_strips`; 0x512000 does the placing. 0x513a40 frees it
       all at the mission's end. 0x513d90 (from 0x517e45, a crater) sets flags 5 on clutter within a
       radius in the grid. 0x514170 is called from 0x564c67, 0x574999, 0x574b89, 0x590c79: not read.
       0x510830, 0x510910, 0x5109c0, 0x510b50, 0x510b90 are called from the 0x4863ec.. range: not read.
     - **World lighting in the debug start (2026-11-04).** `mw3pm --fly` now runs the mission's own
       script (`c1.gs`, with USEZBD and HARDWARE) instead of reading `gamez.zbd` directly, then the
       shipped `support\additive.gw`, and PM's `world.zrd` reader (`mech3/mission_world`, 0x495ba0,
       0x495250: `defaults`, optionally a mission's block). **What the four worlds' scripts use**, run
       with USEZBD: 37, 53, 37, 62 lines. Tolerances (`SetBFETolerance 0.00005`, `SetInverseZTolerance`,
       ...), `SetVertexShading on`, `LightMapTexture lightmap`, `Object3DSetScrollAlways`, `AddClutterTemplates`
       (3, 2, 3, 2), `CycleTexture*` (c2, c4), `LoadSoils`, `MipBias -1`, `GameZReadZBDFile`. Everything else
       in the 30 scripts (`LightNew`, `WorldOrigin`, `LoadGameGen`: 491 lines) is in `ifndef USEZBD` blocks:
       the data was compiled from them, and the lights come from `gamez.zbd`. No script uses
       `LightSetLightMap`, `LightSetBicolored`, `NodeSetOverride*`; of PM's 12 words missing from the
       dispatcher only `TextureAdditiveTransparent` (104 textures, fire, flares, sparks, explosions: that is
       what sets the additive bit) and `MipBias` are shipped (`test_pm_additive.py`).
       **What was wrong before:** strips have no face normal, and without `SetVertexShading on` no vertex
       normals, so the sun gave them nothing (ambient 0.11, dark, with polygons the bright triangles of the
       `--map-light` shot beside them). That script line is the fix; those triangles are gone.
       `world.zrd`: fog (`hwrange`, colour, altitude, `node`), `camera nearfar_clip`, `sun` (orientation,
       diffuse, ambient, `diffuse_color`, `ambient_color`, which turn on PM's own colours), `fluctuate`. PM's
       light setters keep mixed colours and test static by 0x200 (`test_pm_light_setters.py`). 0x495dd0(1)
       after the blocks: the sun on, then off without its option (0x40b360, a parameter here), the clouds on
       unless the last `fluctuate` had amplitude 0 (c1's m2 does). `test_pm_world_params.py` runs 0x495ba0
       and 0x495250 against the port on every block of the four worlds and crafted ones. Since
       2026-11-04 the whole reader is in `mech3/mission_world`, checked the same way, the game and `--fly` use
       it: wind, weather, temperature, jet ceiling, `ai_headlights`, underwater, `cloud_cover`, the
       puffers' reset (0x564ac0). PM has no `mpinfo.zrd`: the caller 0x495b30 takes multiplayer's block from the
       game object's vt +0x74 (`this+0x7640`), the `game_block` hook, null until step 8. Rain and snow's own
       classes (0x5c6010, 0x5c65e0, 0xc0 bytes against MW3's 0x98) are stubbed in the test and still MW3's in the game.
     - **Day and night.** Only c1 has `night_day.zrd`. `day`: single m1, standalone sa1, sa2, sa3, instant
       action, multiplayer. `night`: single m2 and m5, standalone sa4; those three are also `world.zrd`'s dim
       blocks (sun diffuse 0.15, ambient 0.05, against the defaults' 1.0 and 0.2). c2, c3 and c4 call neither
       and have one block. `--fly` shows `defaults` with `day`, so c1 there is a day mission's light.
       **The black shape is sky:** `horizon` > `hormain` holds `horizon_top` (flat, colour 0, a wall of radius
       1750), `horscrollday` (`sky01`), `horscrollnight`, stars. The camera follows it (`camera_set_horizon`, as
       0x4087f0's call; before, it sat at the world's origin) and `world.zrd`'s `fog node` picks `hormain`. The
       mission calls `day` or `night` on `horizon` (`night_day.zrd`, below): `--fly` applies it only where the world has that file (c1), `night` for `--variant m2`, `m5`, `sa4`; c2, c3 and c4 have none of those nodes, and their shots are byte-identical with and without the old list.
       **Not reproduced:** `MipBias -1`: read, not applied; the port's textures have no bias (fixes.md).
       **Stubs left in `--fly`:** a mission's depth-only clear is copied, not reached through the state;
       `horscroll*` scroll words run but with no frame's tick.
     - **The sky gap in c2 and c4.** From height, a band between the terrain and the sky that nothing draws.
       The band's rows at three pitches fit a sky ending about 9.1 degrees below horizontal (a fit, not read from
       the mesh) while the ground stops at the far clip, 600 in these two worlds (300 in c1 and c3, no gap up to
       y 500), so it opens about 96 units above the ground 600 away. At (1536, y, -1792), look 0 8, in c2:
       0 pixels at y 60, 1,687 at y 100, 73,602 at y 150 (at 1280x960); c4 at y 100: 1,079. `jet_ceiling` is 130
       in c2 and 145 in c4, so the ceiling does not rule it out. Whether a jet reaches it waits for ground
       queries on PM's models: come back to it then. PM's mission clears colour to 0 (0x45129a) and turns the
       colour clear off (0x451282, 0x4838db; 0x488f27 turns it on elsewhere), and the port's back buffer starts
       black (`SdlRender3D`; it used to hold undefined memory, magenta on this Mac), so the gap is black in
       `--fly`, which stays depth-only like the mission: there it keeps what the last frame left, which is
       black until something draws there.
       **For Owen's PC:** `docs/pm-eye-checks.md`, with the brightness of c1 and c3.
     - **Eye check, settled here** (no original compared, only that the port draws what the data says):
       the sky: day and night differ as `night_day.zrd` says (`--fly c1 --pos 2432 25 -2688 --look 0 -25`: clouds
       and small stars; with `--variant m2`: large stars, dim clouds), c2 clouds over a fog-coloured horizon
       (`--fly c2 --pos 1536 40 -1792 --look 0 -5`). c1 and c3 look nearly black from `--fly`'s default height
       because their fog is black with altitude 80..100: at height 25 the ground shows (c1 looking up,
       `--look 0 -25`; c3 `--pos 1664 25 -2048 --look 0 15`). The light map pool: `--fly c2 --pos 1536 40 -1792
       --look 0 15 --map-light 1536 40 -1700 80`, a pool over the water and the near land, soft-edged; the
       blended edge polygons get no map (opaque only). `--look 0` faces +z, so a light at -z of that camera
       lights nothing on screen until its range reaches the frame's near edge. A long polygon near a small
       light (range 5, on the bridge) redraws whole, and 10,360 of its 10,363 changed pixels move by 1 level:
       the map's clamped edge texel is not quite 0.
     - **Eye check, for Owen's PC:** `docs/pm-eye-checks.md`: what he does in the original, the port's picture beside it.
     - **Eye check, waiting:** a short light's pool on a regular polygon, on the mission's lights; a
       projected light over a light-mapped polygon, bugs on and off, on the caster's port; an axis-aligned
       wall's light map seam, on a mission's light on a wall (`--map-light` could stand in, not tried);
       flares, on wiring 0x588910 to `flare_add`; points meeting blended polygons, on 0x59ee90.
3. **The mission**: load, setup and the world parameters (`mission.cpp`
   114 new, 14 of the port's changed), the standalone missions
   (`readersa1..4`), the objectives.
   - **The load `0x492830`: ported and checked** (`Missions::load_world`, `test_pm_mission_load.py`, by call
     traces as MW3's test: every world, hardware and software, card memory, detail, clutter). Against MW3's:
     no `<world>size.gw`; `support\additive.gw` after the textures; the puffers' reset after the effects; the
     clutter after the weapons unless `[0x62cc58]` (`object_lod` 2 or `-noclutter`, the option not offered yet);
     two weapon detail words `[0xb0e434]`, `[0xb0e438]` (written, PM's zWeapon reads them, not ported); no abort
     flag; a software-only strip of `mobilehq`, `the_dude01..16` and the vehicles at the lowest detail
     (never reached: no software path), and that software's own texture level 1 and model scale 2. Not checked
     by the test: the strip with a `mobilehq` that exists.
   - **Left, found on the way: a cell's clutter is not in the world queries.** PM's `+0x40` is the records'
     count, not MW3's fades, so all four queries in `cls_di` (point, ground, segment, line) guard their fade loop
     on `cell_fades`; PM's own for the records (`0x4ffb40`, `0x4ffb90`, `0x4ffc80` and siblings at `0x500270`,
     `0x5007d0`, `0x5017e0`, `0x502a90`) are to port with the collision work, or a mech walks through props.
     `launch_sl_dropship` (the anim the launch asks for) is not found in c1m1: not looked into.
   - **The setup `0x493ca0`: ported and checked** (`Missions::setup`, with begin `0x492130` and the cheats' check
     `0x495110`; `test_pm_mission_load.py`'s second entry, every game type -1..5). Against
     MW3's: the block key is the game object's vt+0x58 (`m%d`, `ia%d`, `mp%d`, `sa%d`, else `default`, as
     `block_name`), the mission's own `reader<key>.zbd` is mounted by vt+0x64 before the load (`Missions::start`),
     new progress lines, the in-out call is an empty function, standalone (type 5) is a new case
     (`start_standalone_<key>`), and the objectives are the game object's vt+0x3c: single player's
     (0x435140) reads `objectives.zrd`'s block by the key as MW3's; training's sets (0x437f20, `<key>_set`,
     `<key><n>`), standalone's `sainfo.zrd` (0x40dac0) and PM's objective reader 0x45d620 are still to port.
     `0x4f9930` at the end (zEffect's list) is a no-op hook. The reader paths' string differs too (`aipath`
     in place of MW3's per-mission folder). Not checked: multiplayer's MCB stations (the pilot's +0xc4 is 0 in
     the test).
   - **Objectives and standalone missions** (2026-11-04, from the code; the reader is shared). PM's objective
     reader 0x45d620 is MW3's 0x45c340 in another calling convention (description, the four groups, the mobile
     HQ for type 1, the fail goal count), so `read_objectives` serves both. What changed is the block, chosen by
     the game object's vt+0x3c: training's lessons (0x437f20, MW3's 0x437140) under the key; every other type
     through 0x435140, which takes the game's own block (vt+0x70) or else `objectives.zrd`'s by the key
     (vt+0x58). Only the standalone game can have a block of its own: `sainfo.zrd`'s `objectives` (0x40dac0),
     from the mission's `readersa<n>.zbd`, which 0x40da00 loads with the game; no shipped `sainfo.zrd` has
     one, so every standalone mission reads its world's `objectives.zrd` block `sa<n>` (c1 sa1..sa4, c2 sa1,
     sa2, c3 sa1..sa3, c4 sa1, sa2). Seen: c1sa1's box lists its primary and secondary. `mw3pm --mission c1sa1` starts one
     (ours). The standalone game object itself (vtable 0x5df148: 0x40e1b0 its ctor, sainfo kept at +0x10) is
     the front end's, not ported.
   - **A valve's animation** (`animation_once`): MW3's shipped valves never use one, so the game never wired
     the valves' animation hooks; PM's c1 does (m1, sa1, sa4: `launch_sl_dropship`, the dropship's take-off,
     defined in `reader.zbd`'s `dropship_launch.zrd`). Wired now as the mission's own start animation. c1m1
     launches it at 240 s with the player near the dropship, else at 500 s.
     **Looked at (2026-11-04; c1m1 idle, the player's start view facing north, `--frame-ms 33`, frames
     15,160..16,200, 8:18 to 8:52): the launch draws wrong.** Its smoke is solid white squares (a trail
     climbing behind the dome at 8:51, puffs near the ground at 8:18); the dome in front is not the
     dropship and does not move. Cause, from the code: **PM's puffers are not MW3's.** PM's PUFFER_STATE
     handler (event 42, 0x51bbf0, in the table at 0x639d8c filled by 0x521e0c) reads one more field, flag
     0x400000 at +0xc0 into the puffer's +0x70 (0x566150), so the number moves to +0xc4 and the textures
     (timed +0xc8, names +0xd0), colours (+0x1a4) and growth (+0x220) four bytes on; it returns at once
     when the def's +0xdc is clear, and a node ref of -200 adds the def's +0x80 offset to the translation.
     The port runs MW3's handler, reads empty names, and every puff gets the default texture. PM's
     puffer object differs too (its +0x70 is a float the tick 0x565320 reads; MW3's +0x70 is the node), so
     the fix is PM's puffers as one item: the event, the object, the tick and the draw, with a
     differential (the MW3 one is `test_puffers`). Every PM animation with smoke or fire is hit.
     **Ported (2026-11-04), in place in `gmod_puff` and `zeff_anim_puffer`; `test_pm_puffers.py` against
     PM's exe:** the emission tick 0x565320, the particle draw 0x563f10, the event 0x51bbf0, the gate
     before the first reset, on random puffers, frames, views and events (120 runs: 1,076 ticks, 6,711
     particles, 14,425 sprites, 480 events, all identical; 14 breaks caught). The new field is the
     sprites' **priority**: depth and size by (priority x the inverse-Z tolerance + 1), the tolerance being
     `SetInverseZTolerance`'s (`draw_state().priority_scale`, PM [0xa4e090]); the position is not moved. A
     node's turn is its world matrix (0x4ff360). Kept from MW3, same values: each particle's own copy of
     the colour and growth tracks (PM shares one block, dropped by every colour or growth setter). Seen
     only in the test: a timed puffer with no textures reads through a null iterator at the draw (exe and
     port alike). Shipped data makes none (2026-11-04): every compiled PUFFER_STATE event in both games'
     `anim.zbd` (844 MW3, 688 PM, found by type 42 and size) is untimed or names a texture, and no
     text source's TEXTURES / TEXTURE_SEQUENCE is empty (76 MW3, 104 PM). Not a crash in either game. Not covered by the test: the tick of
     every particle (0x564710, read but not compared line by line with MW3's) and the sprite itself (0x588c50, the shared draw).
   - **Shadows (2026-11-04): the dark quad in front of the player was a port fault, fixed.** A shadow set
     (kind 1, PM 0x005a04bb..) draws through `draw_primitive` with COLOROP SELECTARG1; the SDL backend honoured
     that only in `draw_multi` (MW3's shadow pass), so it modulated the caster's image by the vertex colour
     (the night's dim light) and the multiply blend made the caster's whole box a flat dark quad. The backend's
     `draw` now takes the texture alone too (`sdl_render_shadow_set_takes_the_texture_alone`, with a break).
     The exe has no guard for an empty image and needs none: an image with nothing cast is white (the ramp's
     first grey), and white under SELECTARG1 and the multiply changes nothing, so the exe draws no dark quad
     there. Seen: c1m1 at frame 900 from the cockpit, plain ground where the quad was.
     PM's caster is ported (`shadow_model_with`, 0x55dec0: the PM model's corner count 0x3ff and strip flag
     0x2000), not yet compared with the exe. It casts nothing yet: **a mech's tree copy carries no PM model**.
     `copy_node_model` (MW3 0x4f90e0, PM 0x50cd10) copied `model` only, so every part of every mech made from
     mechlib had neither `model` nor `pm_model`, and the mechs were not drawn.
   - **The tree copy (2026-11-04): ported, mechs draw.** `test_pm_mechlib.py` copies shipped and crafted trees on
     both sides (0x50d7c0, 0x50d830) and compares every model, node and material. PM's differences from MW3's:
     the node's model copy and set-model on PM's model (0x50cd10, 0x4fcc60); PM's model copy 0x559340 and
     model-changes 0x55b0b0 (every material of a polygon; its material copy and test are MW3's in another
     calling convention); the box selection copied (0x50d061); 0x50d830 takes the model copy as well, and its
     animation callers pass [0x60f384..8c], all 1, never written; the child link marks the child's subtree moved
     (0x4ff6d0: bit 25, +0x2c bit 0, an object3d's stale matrix; MW3's has no mark); the model's radius sums z
     first (0x55b326), which can change its last bit. Seen: `--mech-ahead 40`, c1m1 frame 300, the target Mad Cat
     in the view and the target window. Left: a PM model is never released (no 0x559xxx free ported, so a copy
     is kept); the LoD copy's fade fields (0x515c00, PM +0x34..) stay zero, what shipped trees compute, no test
     reaches another value.
   - **The casters compared with the exe (2026-11-04).** `test_pm_shadows.py` loads mechlib trees over c1 and
     runs init, new, size, node, enable, colour, position and draw (0x55d740..0x55da40, the walk 0x55de50, PM's
     model caster 0x55dec0, the filler 0x57eff0, the blur and ramp) on both sides at 24 and 53 bits: every
     caster field and every drawn image identical. Two fixes: the draw's box is the one PM's +0x70 points at
     (0x4fd9d0), and a parent's children's box (0x4feba0) takes each child's box through its +0x70 too
     (`parent_box`); a mech's parts keep theirs in the model slot (+0x8c), so the port's +0x74 gave every
     mech a zero box and no shadow. PM's record is 0x90 bytes: the texture at +0x64, the list's links at
     +0x88 / +0x8c (MW3 +0x60, +0x84 / +0x88), the functions cdecl; the draw, its 3x3 pass and ramp are MW3's.
     The bench clears the filler's stack and sets the level edges as the port's FIX (bug) does (PM's four
     places 0x57f13d, 0x57f240, 0x57f347, 0x57f44a, EDX the entry, ESI the point), as test_shadow_image.py.
     Not here: the upload and release (the device's tests), posed or morphed trees. 12 of 16 breaks caught; the
     rest no shipped mech tree reaches: corner count over 255, a zero-area facing test, a morph, a LoD at the root.
   - **For the mech step (from dev 2, 2026-11-04).** PM's roster has 25 mechs (0x608238, 0x3c bytes each:
     annihilator 0 .. vulture 24, MW3's 19 in `mech_names.cpp` still); the HUD's MFD view (0x4440b0) and lock
     (0x4455e0) ask `HudHooks::mech_pm_roster`, which `app_hud.cpp` answers by name until the roster is ported.
     A torso attachment: PM's torso +0x7c holds an object (read 0x41f930, shown 0x41b900 via 0x479c30, hidden
     0x41b930 via 0x479c60, its +0x20 vt+0xc on/off); the MFD view turns it off while drawing the mech, stubbed in
     `app_hud.cpp` (`torso_attachment` false). The radar's C3 ring reads equipment kinds 6, 7 at PM's mech +0x3bc.
   - **PM's command table (2026-11-04): ported.** 0x411a10's 110 commands, against MW3's 105, and 0xb0 entries
     against 0xa7 (`controls_cfg`; `input_init`): new `CMD_HEADLIGHT_TOGGLE` 0x3c, `CMD_TARGET_NEXT_L` 0x49,
     `CMD_TARGET_CLOSE_L` 0x4c, `CMD_TARGET_PREV_L` 0x4f; MW3's no-key 0x3e is `CMD_EJECT` 0x3f, its debug 0x7e
     `CMD_SNAPSHOT` 0x86; no `CMD_LOOK_REAR`; 49 ids moved, everything from MW3's 0x61 up by 8. `test_pm_ctlcfg.py`
     (test_ctlcfg.py moved to PM's exe) compares the defaults, reads, writes and the mode over 400 random steps.
     Every user follows PM's numbers, checked against 0x41cad0's switch and 0x536c30's callers: the mech's
     dispatcher, the HUD's, the key callbacks, the hat, the pockets, the chains' Exit Mission; the mech's 103
     callbacks are PM's list. PM's reader seeds an entry with no source from the argument's slot (0x412a26),
     docs/controls.md. The dispatched ids against the exe (2026-11-05): all 103 of the mech's registrar in order; the app keys 0x69, 0x78,
     0x86, 0x74; the mission's 0x79, 0x7a; the pockets' 0x5d..0x60, from the table 0x606f90 by 0x469b71 (the same ids as
     in the registrar). The switch's cases match but for the three lancemate keys below. Ours: 0xa2, 0xa5.
     **0x41cad0 is ported with its new cases (2026-11-05, `test_pm_command.py`, 103 commands, every key's call log and
     writes):** eject (0x3f) makes the mech its own attacker (+0x688), runs 0x41de60 and destroys its own head (+0x3b4
     vt+0x20 (0, 1)); the lancemate keys 0x49, 0x4c, 0x4f (0x4e6ca0, 0x4e6fb0, 0x4e6710, run for real against the port:
     a contact in sight whose vehicle's +0xbc has bit 4). The differential also found what the id check could not:
     0x41de60 no longer clears +0x634's bit 0 and in the low detail table acts only for the player; MASC's key
     refuses a limping leg (+0x5d0 0 or 1); Z and Q pass over an entity whose vt+0xac is nonzero (a mech's 0x41da90,
     shut down or shutting; 0x5ead98's 0x4aafc0 is +0x294 == 1, that class is not checked in the port); DIRECT_AWAITCMD
     (0x4e7680) saves only a lancemate and keeps +0xbc bit 5 saying one is held, and 0x4e76d0 clears only that bit;
     the fire mode key has no sound and writes time + 1 at the manager's +0x20 (no reader found yet). Stubbed there,
     not checked: the heat keys, which `test_command.py` also covered; 0x41f900's toggle has `test_pm_headlight`.
     `test_command.py` stays retired. **MW3-exe tests on `pm`:** `mw3probe` is not a target here (`MW3_BUILD_MW3`), so
     `test_deaths.py` loads whatever `build/libmw3probe` a checkout last had (here 2026-11-04 15:37): its pass does not
     test this tree, its results say nothing about `pm`. Its lod check is gone since lod is PM's own on this branch
     (`test_pm_lod.py`), and `test_pm_command.py` now has 0x41de60; its other sections (dead_step, dead_update, on_kill,
     marks, end, release, fly, fade, free, anim_nodes, canned, cockpit, part_lod) have no PM test yet, and neither has the
     same goes for the 62 tests in `tests/differential` that load `libmw3probe`: to do, a list by test, before they can be claimed for PM.
4. **Mechs and weapons**. The command table is done (above). **The rosters are ported (2026-11-05, `test_pm_names.py`,
   `mech3/mech_names`, `mech_ids.h`):** 25 mechs (0x608238, 0x3c each: +0x20 message, +0x24 index, +0x28 tons, +0x2c class,
   +0x30 tech, +0x34 a flag no function read here, +0x38 the definition's cache) and 56 weapons (0x608818, 6 dwords: name,
   message, family 0x4875a0, index, techs, ammo). The ids moved: the Elemental is 11 and the Mad Cat 13 (each MW3 test
   checked in the exe's twin), the Black Hawk and Owens test 4 and 16. PM has MW3's missing plain PPC at index 8, so MW3's
   FIX (bug) is gone here. **`0x4d5020`, MW3's "is it the Elemental" (0x426080), always answers 0 in PM:** the mech
   lists (0x4732b0, 0x48f970, 0x48f660, the store's 0x49ea10) offer the Elemental, and `0x427360` no longer exempts it from
   validation. The table's checksum at 0x4876f0 is MW3's 0x4854c0 (`protection.md`). The family is not used by the port yet.
   PM's reader 0x46d690 no longer reads `version`, and `dfn_bushwacker.zrd` ships without it: MW3's check would refuse that mech, so it is gone. **0x46d690 is compared whole on all 25 (`test_pm_mechdef.py`):** the head, skins, part slots, headlight config, firepoints with their new aim limits (+0..+0x14, default tolerance 0.473, degrees in the file), every loadout and item, every report. PM's changes: no `version`; `engine_minmax` read only for the Elemental, and its maximum kept; `hidden` (+0x1e) replaces MW3's "name starts train"; `double_sinks` read when sinks are 10; armor only reported when over (MW3: any difference); a loadout that fails 0x427360 is dropped. The real validation in play: 113 of 113 kept, once the weight charges the Elemental no engine shielding (0x427130's case 8; without that its one loadout was dropped). 0x62cc5c, which would skip validation, is never set. **The loadouts' rules have their differential (`test_pm_config.py`):** weight 0x427130 with PM's numbering (8 the cockpit and shielding, 9 the maximum), validate 0x427360 with an allowance of 0.1 tons (MW3 0.24) and 0x427310 the slots left not negative, 113 of 113 kept with the masses from `weapons.zrd`.
   Our own command ids are free on PM: 0xa2 and 0xa5 are not in the 110, nothing registers or polls them, their keys are unbound.
   Then the definition reader and its new weapons
   (`XPulseLaser_Large`, `HeavyLaser_Large`, `TBOLT5`), the firepoint
   fix-up (`promote1.cpp`, `CZMechFirePoint::CFixup`), `mech.cpp` (130
   new) and `mech_map.cpp` (97 new), the mech data and skins.
5. **The AI**. First: **PM's `inout` loader** (0x4cddb0 with 0x4cdb30, 0x4cd740, 0x4cdff0): without it a
   standalone mission has no boundary once missions run (a play bug; see the zones note). Then targets
   (`zaitarget.cpp`, 162 new), the net editor and
   in/out nets (85 and 73 new), the valves' new keys, the movement modes
   (Circle, Direct, Random Move).
   **Mapped 2026-11-04** (read-only unless marked).
   - **Baseline, measured:** `mw3pm` runs c1m1 on MW3's AI and PM's data with no unported function reached in
     1,800 frames at 33 ms (a 7,500-frame run shows the same behaviour). The Thor wakes near frame 1400, walks 2 km and
     closes to 50-150 m of the idle player; 680 shots by frame 7500. Armor falls on the Thor and on Epona, the ally
     beside the player; **the player's own stays 12.0**, unexplained. So an enemy already walks and shoots; the order
     below is by what differs from PM. The two Shadow Cats stay powered down until the data's 180 s (corrected 2026-11-05; see step 3 below).
   - **`on_mission_start`: ported** (0x4944e0, with 0x4e4b00's `bapon`; both slot +0x10 of the listeners, walked by
     0x4f9960 from 0x483de0's case 9, MW3's 0x481170 case 7; `valves_mission_started`, `test_pm_ai_start.py`). Named
     108 times, in the standalone missions' valves (`readersa*`), not the campaign's. Measured on c1sa1 over 100 s:
     without it the allied `pirate_mate_1` falls to 4.2 of 12 armor (its turrets still hostile, their `setteam` never
     run); with it 12. c1m1 is unchanged.
     0x483de0's case 8 (0x5349d0, then the player's +0x38c vt+0x1c) is not in the port; its caller is not traced.
     Not what the allied turrets needed: those are `aiTurrets.zrd`'s `ALLY` key (0x004a9ce8, the turf_ blocks and
     `turm_ac`; the key's presence, its value unread), the player's side on the turret. The op points were the file's
     name: PM's is `waynet_<block>` (0x00493a90: m1, ia1, sa1, mp1), in reader<key>.zbd, opened before it (0x00407f38).
   - **The boundary's areas: ported** (the variant 0x4cdb30, the loader 0x4cddb0, the match 0x4cdce0, the add 0x4cced0,
     the select 0x4ce290; `zainet_inout`, `test_pm_ai_inout.py`, 798 cases, 5 breaks): names by game type: 1 `inoutm` and
     5 `inoutsa` (ten areas by 0x435db0, the index the mission - 1), 2 `inoutia`, 4 `inoutt` (one). Before this every
     area on `pm` was empty, standalone or not: PM's nodes hold their model in `pm_model`, `model` stays null. Polygons
     skip 0x2000 (MW3 0x400), count 0x3ff (MW3 0xff; the largest here has 313 corners). Measured: c1m1 43 polygons, c1m2
     81, c1m5 81, c1sa1 82, c2m3 121, c2m8 124, c3m6 30, c4m10 73, c4sa2 73; the Thor still walks and fights. The add and
     polygon's reading are checked only by those counts, not against the exe.
   - **The boundary's query and clamp: ported 2026-11-05** (`zainet_inout`, `test_pm_ai_boundary`; step 2 below).
   - **The data's new words** (PM only, every AI file of the four worlds compared with MW3's): valves `on_mission_start`,
     `play_dead`; nets' `valve_assign` of `jumping` / `jumped` (189 each), `via` / `terminus` (626 each; `terminus` is
     read by the aiv record, 0x4ec240 +0xa4). `setteam` and `any_zero` are not new in the exe (the port has them) but
     MW3's data never used them, so they are untested on real files. Most of PM's data-only names are mission
     valves, not code.
   - **Valves' new keys** (0x4f5f50): of retreat_*, scan_delay_*, scan_duration_*, leaveNetRange, approachRange, attack_radius, minRange, the shipped
     files use none as a key (`retreat_time` in c3 m6 is part of a valve's name, `clint_2_retreat_time`; corrected 2026-11-05). **Movement modes** (0x4c31c0): 0 Direct, 1 Zig Zag, 2
     Circle, 4 Random Move, 5 Strafe, and two more names; no text use in the shipped files I searched; nets give the
     mode as a number, so its use is not settled.
   - **New code by address** (356 new, 801 changed in 0x4bd000..0x4f9000, attribution by neighbour only): largest runs
     0x4ca4e0-0x4cbbb0 (2,337 instructions), 0x4c72a0-0x4c8be0 (1,458), 0x4d91e0-0x4d9d00 (1,276), 0x4df320-0x4dffb0
     (1,256), 0x4daa70-0x4db0e0 (1,213), 0x4ea070-0x4eaff0 (1,169). Not yet read; `zaitarget`'s and the net editor's
     functions are mapped only to here.
   - **Order:** (1) `on_mission_start`; (2) the boundary's loader, variant, select; (3) the AI readers compared with
     PM's exe on every shipped file (`test_ai_readers` on `pm`: aiv, valves, nets, targets), which shows what the data
     needs; (4) the clamp; (5) the new behaviours and targets by the runs above, c1 first; (6) the clutter in W58's grid
     with `cls_di`'s PM queries (with dev 1, who owns collision); (7) movement modes and valve keys as the data asks.
   **The real size (2026-11-05, an estimate, by the mech step's normalized compare; functions/instructions):** without the dev tools (the AI tester dialog, the net editor), same 559/13,021; shape 297/18,663; logic at most 217/26,249; new 397/28,696. 249 MW3 functions in the range have no pair (14,303 instructions), some inlined, some real rows the map can't see. The largest new area is net records and nodes, 160/12,533. **Order:** the readers on every shipped file; the query and clamp 0x4ccaf0; net records, nodes and new behaviours by what a c1m1 and a c1sa1 run reach; targets; clutter in the W58 grid; lance orders with the speed family and the mech's +0x14c; AI firing and weapon helpers, unless a run pulls them earlier.
   **Readers against the exe (step 1, in progress; `test_pm_ai_nodes`):** the net node's properties 0x4ec240 on 574 files and 14,212 nodes (`via` on 626, `terminus`, `static_mfb`), targets 0x4f1c20 on 42 files and 136 records (18 with `mpoption`, `load_limit`, `footfall_anim`), aiv 0x4f0830 on 45 files and 961 records, including the `target` block (438 records, +0xcc..+0xe8) and the flags' new default 0x3fec1. Each compares the exe's record with the port's, field by field, and each new key's break was caught. Not compared: the aiv's region pointer (0x4d0fc0 is stubbed on the exe's side). Read and stored, nothing uses them yet: `via`, `terminus`, `static_mfb`, `mpoption`, `load_limit`, `footfall_anim`, the `target` block. Found by the compare: PM's aiv matches the voice names with `_stricmp` (0x4f10bf), and its records say `epona_rhi`, `alan_mattila`, `dominic_paine`; the port's exact match gave all three no voice. MW3's compare is an inlined strcmp (0x4dffb8), exact, and its 71 such records are spelled with capitals (two misspell Alan, the known fix), so `main` stays exact. The voice is the only compare in the AI range that went from exact to any case: `_stricmp` there is 0x4cdce0 (the in/out variants, in both games) and 0x4f0830. Functions outside the range that use it and are called from it are the same in both games (0x47bf10, `mech_index` 0x486730, 0x4869e0, the reader's 0x578d50 and 0x578e40), and one new call, the net node's `jump` through 0x578d50, is ported.
   **The boundary (step 2, 2026-11-05).** PM rewrote it; MW3's query, way round and nearest are gone from the port, with PM's in their place. *The polygon* 0x4c9af0, 0x4c9600: corners of 0x54 bytes, crossings tested on the pushed-out outline, not the corners; a size class by the distance round: to 20,000 width 3, far limit 15,000, near 1,000, inside limit 2; to 35,000 width 12, 3,500, 500, 4; past it width 12, 10,000, 500, 4. A corner's miter is exact, so the outline keeps its width at sharp turns. *The query* 0x4cc7f0: the polygon this vehicle met last goes first, the others only if that changes nothing; a crossing hardly past a corner's turn is skipped (0x4ca690). *The answer* 0x4cbbb0: inside and within the inside limit, it's moved out half a unit past the side and goes on; inside and deep, that place is the answer; past the near limit from the side, short of the first crossing; a long way round (past the far limit), a via, else the next side's middle if in a clear line, else its corner; else the corners round the shorter way, the last clear one. MW3's answer has only the last of those and the first's plain version. *The vias* 0x4cf350, 0x4cba50, 0x4cf730: nets' via nodes within 100 of a side listed on it and on the corners within 100 along; only for a mech with jump jets (+0x3e8); the cheapest by the way round to it, its length, and the way on. *The record* on the vehicle 0x4ccaf0: kept for the polygon met last and the via (`InOutLast`), which 0x4e0790 reads; its other words have no reader found.
   **Compared** (`test_pm_ai_boundary`, 200 areas, 24,000 queries, 8,000 clamps through vehicles, every corner's words and the query's state, exe against port, 0 differ; 38 of 45 breaks caught, the 7 missed being what's listed next). **Shipped polygons (`test_pm_ai_boundary_real`, 2026-11-05):** every area of the four worlds through the port's loader, all ten campaign missions, all eleven standalone, Instant Action on each (training has none): 25 areas, 1,896 polygons, 14,864 corners (16 polygons in the wide class), each built by both and every corner's words compared; 594,560 queries round each corner and side through the port, 7,618 of them on the exe, including the rare ones: 0 differ. No via nodes there, so `ways` off. The nearest side's branch in 0x4cc1f6 (`round_to(q.nearest, ...)`, within 1.5) is reached 68 times, and breaks of the 1.5 up and down, the branch off and removed are caught there. The test that both ways agree: no shipped polygon reached has them disagree within 1.5 (8 past it); the star test does, 11 times, 0 differ, but its break is missed on both tests (the hunt picks by the port's own outcome, which the break moves, so the exe isn't asked), so that one test rests on reading. **Rests on reading:** the condition `from_in && to_in` beside the crossing count is dead, as `to_in` always counts one; 0xc + 1 can't happen by the limits; the box's NaN handling matches the asm by reading, no shipped case. The loader's own output isn't compared (the choice of areas is, in `test_pm_ai_inout`), nor the ground under the corners: heights are as in the file, the queries in x and z. **Not wired:** nothing fills the vias in play yet (`inout_add_via`, the walk 0x4c7d60 over nets; step 3 with net records), and `ways` is false at the hook until the mech's jet count is named. Old users: `test_program.cpp`'s scenarios and `probe_inout.cpp` compile checked only; `test_inout_query` stays to move.
   **Step 3's first test: c1m1's Shadow Cats (`pm_c1m1_shadow_cats_wake`, in `mw3pmtests`, with `MW3_CAMPAIGN=1`, six minutes).** They do wake, at the data's time: `mission_start` delays `shadowcat_time` 180 s, `shadowcat_go` is any-nonzero of it and `shadowcat_close`, and that valve's `shutdown` powers them up. In the run both are up at frame 11,250 (180 s), go 1. The earlier note that they stayed down came from runs that ended sooner or weren't read at that time; no bug here. It shows the valves and the power-up acting; not that either then fights as PM's would.
   **The attack's leaves, bottom-up (2026-11-06; the attack state 0x4dedf0 reaches 87 unported functions the trace ran, 8,720 instructions, through vtables too).** Each lands unreached until the orders' switch. *The steering* 0x4dc0f0..0x4dcb30 (`zai_steer_pm`, the brain's +0x210): MW3's `Steer` (+0x250), so twins the map partly left unpaired, with real changes. Its constants are fields (the ease, near 10 where MW3 has 20, the keep's slope and scale, the push's reach 40 and band 15). A segment of no length points back along the vehicle. `set` keeps the carrot where it was, or where the vehicle is, if that's within 50 of the new segment. `advance` stays on the segment (MW3's doesn't clamp). The contact push is rewritten: only to the side, from the contact's span against the carrot and the vehicle, within `near_dist` of the line. The loop stops at a contact with no entity or target (MW3 skips it). The measure does nothing for a halted vehicle (vt+0x150). *Compared:* `test_pm_ai_steer`, 300 plans, 5,966 lines of fields within 1e-3, the exe's own functions against the port; 40 of 42 breaks caught. The two missed: `push_amount`'s no-entity answer, which the loop's own check keeps it from reaching, and which of the two pushes wins when both apply, where both give the same number.
   *The walking context* (`zai_walk_pm`, vtable 0x5eec2c, constructor 0x4d9870): one frame's turn and throttle toward the carrot, what MW3's node state and its kin do in line, as virtual slots: the aim 0x4d92c0, with a turn-about at the way's end, the turn 0x4d9390, the throttle 0x4d9550, walk 0x4d9680, walk on 0x4d9740, walk straight 0x4d9710, hold 0x4d97a0. Its numbers are on the steering (+0x64..+0x98), from statics nothing writes after start-up. The brake's share is set per pilot from its +0x544. *Compared:* `test_pm_ai_walk`, 300 plans, fields within 1e-3, the exe's own slots against the port; 43 of 43 breaks caught (two only after the plans set the throttle's inputs directly).
   *A fighting state's part* (`FightStatePm`, vtable 0x5eec78; `WalkFightPm`, vtable 0x5eec50): the state's constructor 0x4d9b10, enter 0x4d9be0 (speed and stopping distance from the vehicle's vt+0x124, vt+0x12c, the ranges from the brain's +0x28, +0x2c), reset 0x4d9ce0 and release 0x4d9cc0; its context 0x4d99a0 with the measures 0x4d99e0 and 0x4d9a90, the way's beginning 0x4d9920 and the decision 0x4d9b90. Enter drops `owned` without freeing it, as written. **Compared** (`test_pm_ai_walk`, 300 plans of its own beside the walking context's 300, every field after each step, both answers of each decision reached): 0 differ; 40 of 40 breaks caught. **Rests on reading:** the vehicle's place pointer tested in 0x4d99e0 is never null (0x5cb260), and the boundary record 0x4d9be0 makes at the vehicle's +0xd8 is kept on the first query (`inout_pull`), so neither is compared. Nothing reaches this until the orders' switch.
   *The plan 0x4da1c0* (`FightStatePm::plan`, vt+0x24, the one 750 left after the recount): lays the steering's way, which is measured back from the place to stand, so the first argument of 0x4dc7a0 is the brain's +0x2b8 and the second the place. Too close (under the middle range): the place moved back to the far range. The boundary's pull 0x4ccaf0. Over the middle range + 200: cut to 200 along. The way's stopping point: the middle range, or, pulled and within the near range of the target, the far end of the near range's chord across the way. **Compared** (`test_pm_ai_walk`, every field of the context, state, steering and brain's +0x2b8 after each step): 0 differ; 47 of 49 breaks caught. The two missed change nothing: the 0.01 apart against 0 sits beside a limit of at least 200, and `near > |side|` is already false at near 0. **Not ported, can't run (reading):** (1) 0x4da333..0x4da401: the state's vt+0x28 is 0x51a4d0, which returns 0, in all three tables holding 0x4da1c0 (0x5eec78, 0x5eecd4, 0x5ef224). (2) 0x4da42d..0x4da492: the context's vt+0x24 is 0x51a4d0 in the contexts these states make (0x5eec50, 0x5eecac, 0x5ef1fc); this was the only reader of the record's +9. This one rests on dev 1's reading of the contexts' vtables alone; the lead checked (1) independently, not (2). (3) 0x4da5a6..0x4da941, the lane check, the only reader of the temporary records' +8: behind the byte 0x62fb20. A raw search of the whole exe, `.rdata` and `.data` included, finds its address once, at the read 0x4da59a; no data table or console variable points to it; it lies past `.data`'s raw size, so it starts at zero. A write through a computed pointer isn't disproved but is very unlikely: its neighbours aren't one array with it and nothing seen points to a base before it. If a trace ever shows that byte non-zero, it's a port bug. The neighbour 0x62fb1c has the same pattern (read once, 0x4d78f7) and gets the same treatment when reached. The debug console work (S8) can come back to both. So `InOutLast` needs no new fields. The pull's fifth argument only lands in the area's +0xb8, which no query reads, so `plan` doesn't pass the state's +0x34.
   *A port bug fixed with it (2026-11-06):* walk 0x4d9680 and walk on 0x4d9740 call 0x4ccaf0 with the carrot as both the place and the answer, so a pull moves the carrot. The first port's hook took it const and dropped the answer, and the test's stub never wrote one, so the 0 differ didn't cover it. The stub now writes on both sides and putting the bug back is caught. Unreached code; nothing played it. *Owed before the switch's commit:* a test or a line of account for each of the 14 small boundary helpers counted as done because they're inlined (0x4c7e10, 0x4c7e50, 0x4c7f30, 0x4c9220, 0x4c9260, 0x4caa60, 0x4caca0, 0x4cab20, 0x4cad50, 0x4cade0, 0x4cb730, 0x4cae10, 0x4cc970, 0x4ccac0), so far judged only from their callers.
   *The jump state* (`zai_jump_pm`, vtable 0x5eedbc, constructor 0x4daf40, run 0x4db0e0, the largest function of the attack's list): a changed twin of MW3's `JumpState` (0x4cb330, 0x4cb4b0). The same five timed parts, but PM turns on the spot first (phases 0, 1, with its own turn 0x4d7060, MW3's 0x4cdd40 with the parameters passed), starts each timer as its phase comes rather than all at the start, steers in the air, works out the forward jets from the speed still needed on the way down, and in the glide holds the climb's top height (the plan's new +0x20) with computed jets until it's within the descent's distance. The plan 0x4dac40 is MW3's 0x4cb120 with the height added; the fall uses the jets at 0.01 less gravity instead of gravity alone. Each frame it sets the mech's +0x588 to 1 ([0x60bb70], 1 in the data, nothing writes it; MW3's matching byte is 0). By reading, that field is MW3's jet fuel +0x564, so PM's AI would jump on a full tank; this rests on how the field is read and isn't compared in play. **Compared** (`test_pm_ai_jump`, 300 plans, 14,181 lines, the state's and steering's fields and each call to the controls in order, all eight phases reached): 0 differ; 68 of 68 breaks caught, six of them after widening the test's inputs (a stale value in the cross, other turn parameters, a jump with no height, no jets, no mech). A tolerance let `inf` match `FLT_MAX`; non-finite values now compare exactly here and in the steering and walking tests. **Rests on reading:** a next step with no way point is a crash in the exe and in this port (MW3's port has a FIX for the same thing); decide at the switch. The exe's `_hypot` is the root of the squares.
   *The guarding context* (`WalkGuardPm`, vtables 0x5ef2a0, 0x5ef30c, constructor 0x4dfb50, measure 0x4dfc30) and *the order's target for a fight* (0x4daa70's own part, `take_order_target`): the target comes through the order's +0x0c, vt+0x1c, vt+0x18, vt+0x50, and the exe has no answer when that chain ends in none (a crash in the exe and in this port; decide at the switch). **Compared** (`test_pm_ai_walk`, 300 more plans): 0 differ; 11 breaks, 10 caught on the first run, the one missed caught after the probe's stub checked which target it was given. A second miss was a redundant line in the port, removed: the base constructor already refreshes the place.
   *The attack state* (`zai_attack_pm`, 0x4dedf0): a state machine in the flags' high nibble over the fighting state's walk: 0 begins (the fighting state's enter, +0x1f0 the speed less +0xb4, +0x108 the delay by the difficulty's [0x62cc60] and the time, rounded once; a place to hold kept at +0x44, the nearest behaviour of the order two from the back or the vehicle's own place, the brain's +0x104 on it); 0x10 fights; a lost target (no_target, or the walk on steps 1, 3, 5 when the order's kind has a behaviour) queues a 0x5eeca4 order and goes to 0x20; 0x20 and the fall-through make the way back to the hold (range 20, +0x3c 0, +0xfc from +0x58) and go to 0x40; 0x30 and 0x40 walk it until lost, then 0x50; 0x50 gives up: +0x108 max, +0x104 cleared, and when both +0x5c and +0x60 are 0 mode 1 with +0xfc max, then a 0x5ef254 (with a behaviour) or 0x5ef250 order at the front; in mode 1 it starts over. Above 0x50 it does nothing. **Compared** (`test_pm_ai_attack`, 10,000 steps, 17 of 17 meaningful breaks; the five flag masks are the same operation, so they can't be broken): the state machine, with the context 0x4debe0 and the functors 0x4dedb0, 0x4e1fc0, 0x4eab40 not yet ported or compared, and 0x4c7800 and 0x4e5580 stubbed.
   *Driving at the carrot* (`zai_drive_pm`): the drive 0x4dcd20 (MW3's `walk_drive` 0x4cee80), the turn 0x4d7060 and turn-or-back 0x4d71e0 (0x4cdd40, 0x4cdee0, with their constants passed; [0x62fb08] is 5 degrees, its behind at cos 175), the away measure 0x4dccf0. [0x62fbb0] (no backing up) is never set: the disassembly names it once, at the read 0x4dcd3a, and it lies past `.data`'s raw size (not the raw search of the whole exe done for 0x62fb20). **Compared** (`test_pm_ai_walk`, through every plan kind): 0 differ; 29 of 29 breaks caught. *A port bug fixed with it (2026-11-06):* the steering's `x40` (+0x40) had 0x4dc0c0's cos 20 degrees; the exe's is 0x4dbf80's cos 45 degrees. Nothing read it until the drive, so the steering test's 0 differ didn't cover it. `test_pm_ai_walk` now compares every constant the steering's constructor sets, and putting the wrong value back is caught.
   *The walk to where it can fight from 0x4d9d00* (`FightStatePm::step`, called from the attack state): eleven steps in the low four bits of the state's +0x08. It re-plans when `until` passes (a second after each plan), holds once in range, walks by `walk` near the carrot or `walk_straight` further off, and when a plan's pull ended on a via node queues a pending item (vtable 0x5eeca4, the via's two words) on the brain's +0x15c and goes to step 8 or 9. Its target gone, the brain's +0x2b8 takes the carrot, step 10. The queue is a hook here; the list itself (0x4ea0f0) lands with the order pieces. **Compared** (`test_pm_ai_walk`, every step reached, the queue's count and words, the controls' last values and how many were sent): 0 differ; 44 of 46 breaks caught. The two missed change nothing: step 10 clears `wake` and `until`, and the plan that follows overwrites both. *Target null:* a measure on a null target faults in the exe and in this port, so the test reaches `no_target` through a dead target, whose place is good.
   **PM's AI at 53 bits (2026-11-06).** The reference runtime runs the x87 at 53 bits (CLAUDE.md, measured 2026-11-04), and a float port is the 24-bit path. They differ where a value is built to equal another and a later compare turns on the last bit. `set` measures the old carrot along a way starting from that same place, so `along_at` comes out about `length` on each fresh way, and `length < along_at` went the other way in 982 of 3,000 such ways. So the steering, walking context, drive and jump follow the exe's evaluation; `test_pm_ai_steer`, `_walk`, `_jump` match it to the bit at 53 bits and no longer at 24. This matches the original; it isn't a fix.
   What's stored and what stays in the register, by function. 0x537e60 and `set`: each difference stored to a float. 0x4dbf10 (`unit_flat`, root stored): sum and root in the register, the root stored, 1 over the stored root unrounded, each word stored. 0x4013d0 (`unit_flat`, root not stored): the same with 1 over the unrounded root. 0x4dc320, 0x4dc980: differences unrounded, each product and the sum in the register, the sum stored. 0x4dc290: each product stored, the sum in the register. Dots and crosses (`wide_sum`): stored from the register, and compared stored. The turn's gain and the throttle's sum: in the register for their compares. 0x4dcb30: `along_at - dt * rate` is compared in the register, and the across too. 0x4dac40: the ratio and k stay in the register, the times are stored, the total stays in the register for the need. vt+0x124 returns in the register unrounded. 0x41e280's argument is pushed as a float. 0x4dc400 stores `by` once, so it's the same at both precisions.
   **The ties.** Fresh ways (`test_pm_ai_steer`, 3,000, both sides the same to the bit): above 775, equal 1,459, below 766. Arrivals at the end, over many lengths, 0x4dc400's clamp: above 49, equal 2,902, below 49. Arrivals at the minimum: above 265, equal 2,466, below 269. So the exe itself overshoots the end now and then; the port does the same at the same inputs. **In a walk:** 400 simulated walks of 900 frames in the exe at 53 bits, with moving targets and stuck mechs: 776 plans that reach the test, 0 on a tie and 0 taking that way, because `update` moves `along_at` off the tie each frame. That's a simulated walk, not a trace, so a rate of 0 or a plan with no update between could still reach it. The 1 in 900 seen before this came from the test's own stub, which worked in Python doubles against the probe's floats.
   Breaks putting one step back in float: 14 of 17 caught. Missed: `update`'s compare, which can't change anything (a double under the minimum rounds to at most the minimum); `near`'s and the keep's sums, kept as the exe has them, with no case found where they matter.
   **The boundary at 53 bits.** This one is live in `mw3pm`, under the stand-in AI too. Before the change a via's corner flipped (8 against 9) at 53 bits, in `nearest`. Now `test_pm_ai_boundary` (24,000 queries, 8,000 pulls) and `test_pm_ai_boundary_real` (7,618 queries on the exe) match to the bit at 53 bits. What it stores: the side's differences; the side's dots (`wide_sum`, `dot3`), distances, the side sums over stored differences (0x4c9220, 0x4c9260), t; in the register: the root and 1 over it in 0x4c85b0, the miter's quotient, the lerp 0x4c80a0, and 0x4c80f0's root, which is why 0x4cca00 stores the first distance, adds the second in the register, stores that, then adds the corners' difference. Breaks putting one step back in float: 10 of 11 caught; `nearest`'s perp in float was missed, kept as the exe has it.
   **Step 3: why the brain tick isn't a row of its own (2026-11-05, read, nothing ported).** PM's tick 0x4fab90 keeps MW3's outline: the AI switch, power, the sight test, the radio lines, the vlist, the hit test, the attack, the random wait, the order's run, the firing. Three things differ, and they hang together with the orders' model, so changing the tick alone would break the MW3 behaviours the port runs now. (1) *No attack stack.* MW3's attack 0x4e9ca0 remakes the order and pushes end, rearm and return (`AttackNet`, `AttackEnd`, `AttackRearm`, `AttackReturn`, with `x230` and `xe8`). PM has no 0x4e9ca0 at all: 0x4fa150 -> 0x4ea740 is MW3's push 0x4e87c0: the current state suspended (0x4ea5f0: its vt+0xc), a new order from the template (0x4fafe0 -> 0x4faff0, the deque's push_back; orders of 0x84 bytes, 31 to a block), then the vehicle's net and behaviour built on it (0x4f9e70: net vt+0x54 at +0x14, behaviour vt+0x8c at +0x34). (Corrected 2026-11-06: this note first read it as building in the same order. 0x4ea7f0 is `push_behaviour`, 0x4ea690 `push_net`, 0x4ea220 `pop`, 0x4ea3a0 `pop_if`, 0x4ea8d0 `unwind_to`; the map left them unpaired, so they counted as new.) The health limit and time MW3's tick sets for the attack (`x230`, `xe8`) are set by PM's attack state, 0x4dedf0's case 0 (+0x1f0, +0x108). The same call serves 0x4fa170 (a behaviour on the order's own net; `manoeuvre` 0x4fab30 uses it), 0x4d5c60, 0x4dffb0, 0x4fb850, 0x4fba80, 0x4dedb0. (2) *A pending list.* The order deque (brain +0x128) has a list at its +0x38, count +0x3c: 0x4fb260 runs its head first (vt+8; true pops it and installs it, vt+0 on the deque). 0x4ea0f0 adds to it, from 0x4d9d00, 0x4dedf0, 0x4e0790, the via behaviour among them, with the record's via. Empty, the loop is MW3's. (3) *The hit test* gains the weapons' choice: 0x4e9590, then the brain's vt+0x28 with 0x4b2820 (the group of the highest value). Also gone: `x22c`, `own_order_run` ([0x5e9d40]). `may_engage` 0x4fa5a0 is changed too: flags at +0xec, +0x104 and +0x24, the health against +0x50, the time +0x108, +0x1f0. So the next cut is one batch: the order functions' moved slots (0x4ea740, 0x4ea7f0, 0x4f9e70, 0x4f9ec0, 0x4ea690, 0x4ea220, 0x4ea3a0, 0x4ea8d0), the pending list (0x4fb260, 0x4ea0f0, 0x4ea180), the attack state, the tick, `may_engage`, and whichever behaviours end through them, in the order the trace on the original gives.
   **The readers' account (step 1's end, 2026-11-05).** The range is 0x4eb840..0x4f8000: 45 logic rows, 23 new functions, 16 MW3 functions without a pair. *Compared, a test on the function's own result with breaks caught:* the net header 0x4eb960 (574 files, 14 crafted headers for each complaint, its lines moved 5 up in PM), the node 0x4ec240, aiv 0x4f0830, targets 0x4f1c20 with its ctor 0x4f1bd0, the valve record 0x4f38e0, the builder 0x4f5f50 with the makers and fires 0x4f4d60..0x4f5b20 and the conditions 0x4f5b80, 0x4f6c10..0x4f6e20, 0x4f6f00 (these through the builder's test, not one by one). *Not in play, by reading, not ported:* the writer 0x4ecaa0 (its caller 0x4eb840 saves a net), the record compares 0x4f02b0 and 0x4c25a0, the aiv cache's map 0x4f2060, 0x4f2a70, 0x4f29b0 with 0x4f00e0 and 0x4f18e0, what fills the editor's cache. *The record's size only, by reading:* the containers 0x4ed430, 0x4ee080, 0x4eed30, 0x4ef270, 0x4efeb0, 0x4f7290, 0x4f7510, 0x4f7e70 (the net record's 0xb4 to 0xc4, aiv's 0xf8 to 0x118, the moved fields), 0x4f3130 and 0x4f3390 (the file's dtors, more fields to free), 0x4f1810 (the aiv file's ctor). *Read, cached path:* 0x4f7e90, `ValveFile::read`'s cached record, empty in play; its new copy isn't ported. *The 16 unpaired:* six are Ghidra's starts inside a function (0x4e001a, 0x4e0020, 0x4e0082: aiv's voice names; 0x4e46d1, 0x4e4f50, 0x4e574f); the rest are helpers that moved or were inlined, seen in reading, none with a pair checked: the anim action 0x4e30f0, 0x4e3120 (now 0x4f4e20, 0x4f4e50, through the builder's test), 0x4e34b0, the record's ctor 0x4e2190 (0x4f3630), copies and deletes 0x4de930..0x4de960, 0x4e1c30, 0x4e1c40, 0x4e5f30. Of the 23 new, 0x4f4d60, 0x4f5000, 0x4f5050, 0x4f5210, 0x4f57e0 ran in the builder's test; the others (0x4ef160, 0x4ef180, 0x4efa60, 0x4f2fd0, 0x4f5d60, 0x4f5f00, 0x4f5f10, 0x4f7010, 0x4f7500, 0x4f7d90, 0x4f7f30..0x4f7fd0) are by their size and place container helpers and destructors, 0x4f7010 the namelist's insert, which runs in the record's test. *Rests on reading:* the file object around the records (`RdrFile`, the map by name: MW3's, unchanged shape), and the valves' load 0x4f35c0..0x4f3570 (MW3's order). Report lines behind a failed add can't be reached.
   **Valves (step 1):** the record 0x4f38e0 (`test_pm_ai_nodes`: 37 files, 1,736 records, and 38 crafted records for the keys the data never uses) and the builder 0x4f5f50 with the actions and conditions it makes (`test_pm_ai_valves`: every shipped file built and every valve set through values, 41 crafted records with each action alone and all on one valve, so the order counts; each call out, each valve's value and the brains' and targets' words compared). PM's differences, each with where it is: the record is 0x14c bytes (`ValveDef`: the namelist at +0x13c, flags at +0x148); `retreat_dist`, `retreat_time`, `retreat_health` make canleave's switch (the same 0x4e9f00 / 0x4e9f20), between canleave and shutdown; `leaveNetRange` (squared on reading), `attack_radius`, `approachRange`, `minRange`, `scan_delay_*`, `scan_duration_*` are `RangeAction`, one word on the brain (+0x20, +0x44, +0x28, +0x2c, +0x64, +0x68, +0x6c, +0x70), between teleport and the mission's; canleave's second word is the brain's +0xfc, the port's `xdc`; the vehicle's chain is vt+0x48, +0x14c, +0x58, the hooks'; report lines follow the exe's. The world in that test is fake, and only 0x4f5f50's failures that can happen ran: the "Failed to create" lines behind a failed add can't be reached (`new` doesn't fail), so those numbers rest on reading, and timers ran only through the shipped and crafted delayed updates. Nothing but the valve side is checked: whether the brain then uses these words as PM does is step 3.
6. **The front end**: the load/save screens and saved games
   (`%s%02d.mw3`), the saved configurations (`.m3c`), the pilot and
   briefing screens; no movies (zFMV's 21 ported functions are gone).
   **Keeping a PM campaign (2026-11-05):** the pilot file is PM's now (`test_pm_pilot.py`: exe against port, Owen's real save included, byte for byte after a read and write): the version 0x3e with a wipe on a mismatch, five games, the first campaign in the file, the strings, the mission alone, the default mech 5, Instant Action's settings per pilot with their -1 defaults. Multiplayer's fields have their place in the file; their names go by MW3's offsets + 0x18 and three of them have no reader yet (item 8). The standalone record is kept whole; Owen's own is empty, so its unchanged write-back rests on crafted files and what the exe's read and write do. The starting store 0x4351b0 was already ported. Restore (0x435d30) has run on Owen's real `Deathstalker02.mw3` through `--campaign-chain resume:1` to a win, no crash; the restored world is not compared with the exe's. `lance_keeps`: no PM function near the briefing compares the mission with a fixed one, its MW3 rule is never true now and stands, the twin not pinned by the address map. Seen on the way, not ported: 0x404a20's new lancemate warnings before a launch on game types 2 and 5 (messages 0x1e0, 0x1063). The whole `test_pilot` (the screens' calls on stores and games) stays to move.
   **The pilot and save files: mapped** (2026-11-04, read-only, not ported; checked against one real save):
   - **Files.** `pilots\<name>.mw3` the pilot; `pilots//games//<name>%02d.mw3` (0x60559c) a saved world, by the
     mission alone (MW3: `%02d%02d`, operation and mission). `.m3c` is not a campaign file: `configs\<mech>\*.m3c`
     are the mech lab's saved configurations (0x428000).
   - **Header** (0x47af50): 1, version, 0, the version 0x10 + 0x2e = 0x3e (0x479d80; MW3's 0x2f). Only the first
     two words are compared. On a mismatch or a short read the file is reopened **CREATE_ALWAYS** and the header
     written: the pilot is wiped (MW3 used OPEN_ALWAYS and kept the rest).
   - **No checksum** on the pilot: the readers walked (0x47b2f0, 0x435820, 0x473930, 0x474c30, 0x434a20, 0x434b70)
     only ReadFile fields. A saved world is a zSave archive: its header entry's kind must be 2, else the load
     answers false (0x5cbf30, 0x5cbcc0).
   - **The record** (0x47b2f0, MW3's 0x4790d0): five games' reads (+0x78, +0x74, +0x70, +0x80, +0x7c; MW3 four), a
     count, then the campaigns. PM's count includes the first record, read into the first place with no check
     (MW3 saved count - 1). Later records are kept only if vt+0x1c (0x435d80) holds.
   - **A campaign** (read 0x435820, write 0x4356f0, ctor 0x4351b0, 0xe0 bytes): the slot and a store, then
     +0xa0 **the mission, 1..10** (4 bytes; there is no operation), +0x38 a byte, +0xa4 and +0xa8 (3 and 3 new;
     +0xa4 is set from +0xa8 on reading), +0xc0, +0xb0 (16 bytes), four stores, the lancemates (0x434b70: a
     count, then slots), a count and that many strings (0x597280: length, bytes; +0xc4). To name: +0x38, +0xa4,
     +0xc0, +0xb0, the strings.
   - **Mission to world**: 0x435de0: 1, 2, 5 -> c1; 3, 4, 8 -> c2; 6, 7 -> c3; 9, 10 -> c4 (zbd\c<n>). Name `m%d`
     (0x4355d0). Last mission 10 (0x435db0).
   - **Which need a saved world**: 0x435e40 is true for 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 (a world entered fresh). Only 2, 4, 7,
     10 carry on from the mission before: they are written on winning (0x4359e0) and such a record is kept only
     while its file exists (`_access`, 0x596ea0).
   - **Loading a world**: vt+0x24 (0x435d30) when the file exists; the mission load (0x493ca0) only logs the answer,
     so a false starts the mission on the unmodified world.
   - **Checked on Owen's save** (7,322 + 12,388 bytes): header 1, 0x3e, 0; records parse at 0x58e (mission 1), 0xe01
     (mission 2, with `<name>02.mw3` on disk) and 0x17c2 (mission 3, no file), each followed by four stores that
     parse; the saved world starts 8, 2 (kind 2). The stores' strict parse found these three and only small false
     hits with empty stores; the walk from the file's start through the configurations (0x426000) was not done.
   - **To start mission N by editing**: with the game closed and a backup kept, change a record's 4-byte mission
     field, no length change. N in 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 needs nothing else. N in 2, 4, 7, 10 needs `<name>%02d.mw3` to
     exist, from having won N - 1. Not traced: how the pilot screen picks among the records. Not tried in the game.
   **The geometry queries: ported (2026-11-05)** (`zclass/cls_di`, `zmodel/gmod_hit`, `test_pm_di.py`). The ground 0x5003a0,
   point 0x4ff8d0, segments 0x502360 and shots 0x501030, 0x500f80 reach PM's models (0x5675a0, 0x566d60, 0x56a600 with
   0x569290, 0x569b00, 0x567b20): count 0x3ff, strip 0x2000, the first material and UVs, a strip's degenerate triangles
   passed over. Before this `line_node` and the others tested only `node->model`, null on PM, and three of the four box
   helpers read +0x74 for PM's +0x70: no triangle hit anything. A hit's slot is 0x2c bytes: +0x28 the owner, the node's
   +0x40 (0x200000 walks up its parents): a clutter record while a query visits it. The records' four walks: 0x4ffb40,
   0x5007d0, 0x502a90, 0x501a30, through the cell's tree by 0x503c20, 0x503ce0, 0x504100, 0x503ea0. Two-sided is 0x400 on PM (the count takes
   0x100). The sphere query 0x5033b0 is in the test on flagged nodes. Tested on crafted records, not on laid ones. Unreached
   by the test: a count over 255. **Still to look at in play:** jet reach, W58's grid seeing props; why the walker stopped after the prop in c2m3 at (2636, 3, -1528), having lost 0.098 of armor (c3m6's walked on; an eye or exe check against the original). Also open: class 0x5ead98's vt+0xac (0x4aafc0), not handled by `entity_down`, the class not identified; the fire mode's `world().time` standing for the exe's [0x8c1b50], the same clock assumed, not verified; E and W and the other target keys call `AiTarget::set_target` directly where the exe goes through vt+0xcc with the HUD's part (`hud(0x51)`), to fix on `pm` with that part. Clutter's
   `ground_heights` hook stays null: a mission's load sets the laying's skip first (0x492f9a).
   **Headlights go with the mech step (4), as the expansion's headline feature: the player's ported (2026-11-04)**
   (`mech3/mech_headlight`, `test_pm_headlight.py`, the setters in `test_pm_light_setters.py`). In the game: the dfn's
   config, the torso's setup, the key 0x3c, the mech's frame detaching and reattaching it (PM's vt+0x34, +0x3c), the
   death's fade off, the HUD's view hiding the beam. Seen: `pm-c1m2-headlight-on.png`. **Not done:** the AI's: 0x41f4d0's
   budget (0x41f8d0, the mech's distance through 0x465e00) and multiplayer's bit (0x4705e0); until then only a key
   lights one, and its lod stays 1. `CMD_EJECT`'s extra vtable call is not in either. The beam itself is checked as
   a node, not in a picture from outside.
   The light map's real user: a light from `0x50e470` starts with flags 0x8b3, so 0x10 and 0x80 are on by default.
   The headlight's builder `0x479780` sets 0x10 again (`0x50ea00`), clears 0x20 (`0x50ea80`), sets 0x40 from
   `subdivide` (`0x50eb60`) and never touches 0x80 (`0x50ec30`, whose only callers are the script's
   `LightSetLightMap` and the light reader `0x51b500`), so it reaches `0x543b10`'s light map sets. Not seen running:
   read from the code. Who holds what: the mech's dfn has `headlight` (only `model_offset` ships; `0x46d8d0`
   into `0x479440`); settings +0x1a8 are `0x479330`'s, new(0x40) in `0x46d50a`: lodrange 150..200, model offset
   (0, 2, -5), light offset (+0x14, z -80), colour 0.8, ambient and diffuse 0.5, range 40..50, subdivide on. No
   shipped file has `lodrange` or `subdivide`, so these defaults are what runs, unless a `light%d` block overrides.
   The object: `0x479510` (hardware only, loads `headlight.flt`, the facade mode 2's beam) and `0x4795c0`, class
   vtable 0x5e5bd8: a node `spotlight`, the light `light%d` under it, mech +0x7c holds it (`0x465b9b`, in the mech's
   load). In multiplayer (from dev 2, 2026-11-04): the state sync carries the headlight's on/off as bit 31
   of a mech's synced flags (0x4705e0 compares 0x41f920, on through 0x465df0, and sets it by 0x41f8d0); PM's
   HUD never reads it. The toggle: `CMD_HEADLIGHT_TOGGLE` to `0x465dc0`, which flips it by `0x479940` and `0x4799b0`; fading
   through `0x479a40`, whose +0x34 scales the light's ambient and diffuse. The AI's: `ai_headlights` of world.zrd
   is read into the mission's +0x30 (`mission_world`), at [0x62da38], and ported with the level of detail
   (`mech3/mech_lod`, `test_pm_lod.py`). Each frame the budget starts at 0 only with that flag, the light map option not
   -1 and two texture stages (0x41f3d5; the GPU path always has them); otherwise spent. 0x41f4d0 then gives the first
   mech in the near or mid band that is no ally of the player's team, active and not in state 10 the headlight, one a
   frame, by the list's order, and passes it the distance always. Off when powered down (0x41f8d0). vt+0x64 is nonzero
   only on the network mech (0x5e59a8, ctor at 0x47041b): it keeps its synced light. Not ported: that class, and
   [0x6293a9], which nothing writes. **The level of detail is PM's own:** the player's bits, the near band's bit 0
   apart, and two tables set with the mechs (0x414430) by ObjectLOD: 2 is low (near 50 m, mid the far clip or 250 m,
   bits 0x14, 0x10, player 0x15, one sound; the finer bits only for a mech within cos 80 degrees of the view, 0x41f460,
   the gait not for one shut down, no model swap). `lod_setup` reads the clip at the same point (800 in the missions
   measured). Checked in play (c1m2, `--mech-ahead 60`, seed 1, frame 300): the beam shows, c1m1 (flag off) never
   lights. AI mechs fighting with their lights are not seen yet: PM's AI is not running. The HUD never shows it (2026-11-04: no HUD code reads it; its only on/off query, 0x465df0 via 0x41f920, is the network sync's, 0x4705e0 bit 31).
7. **Sound and the HUD**: the sound syntax reader (rewritten smaller), the
   HUD objectives, spot and headlights.
   - **The HUD: mapped** (2026-11-04; MW3 0x43a800..0x448800 against PM 0x43bb00..0x44a000). 159 pairs
     changed, 136 of them ported (`hud.cpp`, `mech_hud.cpp`, `app_hud.cpp`), most by small amounts (offsets or
     the compiler, not read one by one); 10 MW3-only; 16 new in PM. No HUD headlight or "spot" (the
     headlight's `spotlight` node): dev 1's mech step. The order: the objectives box, the damage static, the
     radar's read (0x43dd00 -> 0x43f220, the largest pair difference), the rest by offsets.
     - **The objectives box: done** (`HudObjectives::fill`, 0x004486e0 with 0x00448520 and 0x00448680;
       docs/hud.md section 24, Pirate's Moon): MW3's structure, with game types 1, 2 and 5 headed by the
       game's name (vt+0x08), an objective done by failing (PM's +0x09) shown "Failed" (0x1008), the failed
       group's lines with their status, a further line of an objective with a blank score, and PM's command
       numbers for the keys (0x79, 0x44), looked up by command name so they follow the table in use. Test `test_pm_hud_objectives.py` (300 made-up missions; 9 breaks
       caught). The network score list is MW3's. Left: the game's name in the program (PM's game object).
     - **The damage static: done** (0x0043e1f0 the tick, 0x0043dda0 the noise, 0x0043dfa0 the quad, 0x0043df70;
       docs/hud.md section 21, Pirate's Moon): the warning by health under 0.2, an easing fall, the noise as a
       textured quad on the GPU path only. Test `test_pm_hud_static.py`; 12 breaks caught. Seen on screen (c1m1, health forced low).
     - **0x43d710: MW3's** (the HUD's vt+0x04, vtable 0x5e28a0): MW3's 0x43c6b0 (`Hud::draw3d`) with PM's offsets,
       the same rects, panels, message panel, objectives and 3D views in the same order. Nothing to port.
     - **The radar (0x43dd00 -> 0x43f220): ported** (hud.md section 15). MW3's groups in MW3's order, with
       two changes: the marker's text placed and shown on a change, and the C3 network's ring on the map.
       Test `test_pm_hud_radar.py` (the whole function), `test_pm_hud_toggle.py` (Shift+R, 0x43f090, 0x43ee50).
     - **The rest of the HUD pairs: done** (2026-11-04). Every changed pair in 0x43a900..0x449000 compared:
       normalised pseudocode with integers blanked (125 left of 166), then call arguments stripped, then each
       pair's numeric constants resolved through the globals (8 differ, all explained), and the unpaired
       MW3 and PM functions matched by hand. Real changes, each ported:
       the mission timer 0x597c30 (`test_pm_hud_timer.py`), the missile lock 0x4455e0 (`_lock`), the aim ray
       0x445cf0 and 0x445c60 (`_aim`; the ray itself not run in the emulator), the reticle update 0x445a50
       (`_reticle`), the weapon list's next weapon 0x4480c0 (`_looks`), layout 0x447da0 (`_layout`) and line
       refresh 0x4478f0 (`_refresh`); no exe test: the MFD's camera 0x4440b0 and TARGET's third line 0x442fd0.
       Not ported: the debug readout's two more texts (unported in MW3 too). Compass draw3d 0x440e30 has no
       effect. The largest pairs (0x440b00, 0x442f50, 0x444760) were checked by calls, constants and branch
       counts, not read line by line.
       Waiting on the mech side: PM's roster of 25 (the HUD asks `mech_pm_roster`, by name for now), the torso
       attachment (stubbed in the MFD view). The weapon line's name is PM's table message; the port keeps DESC,
       the same message by name. In this address range, not the HUD: the mech lab (0x448a80, 0x448a20, 0x448e20,
       0x448960, 0x4488b0, 0x448f10 -> 0x44a320), not done.
   - **zSound: done** (2026-11-04, `src/gamez/zsound` in place; docs/sound.md, Pirate's Moon):
     - PM's: the load 0x00591840 and the reader 0x00591900 / 0x005920e0 / 0x00592170 (no SYNTAX, no demo,
       sets made by name 0x00590ae0, INCLUDE_SETS, COMPILE_FORMAT, QPRIORITY, a 3-item keyword step);
       shutdown 0x00591700; sets found in any case 0x00590a20, loaded and unloaded by count 0x00590d70 /
       0x00590f80, unload_all 0x00590950, free_sets 0x00590990; the queue oldest first 0x0058fb60; unpause
       0x00590530; the CD notify 0x005938c0 (mode 3 loops the disc); the range scale 0x00591830; 345 m/s and
       4 duplicates as State's defaults. `Set::sounds` a deque. The rest pairs with MW3's.
     - Test: `test_pm_sound.py` (PM's exe at its own addresses, the shared sound probe in pmprobe), with breaks.
     - Left: mw3pm opening sound at its start (with the mission); the range scale's callers 0x00482ca0,
       0x00408120 (object detail).
7b. **The second campaign, "P I R A T E  M I S S I O N S"** (the exe's "standalone", type 5; `pirates-moon.md`): 11 of the 21 story missions, unported, after the frame's rows in `pm-mech-step.md`. Read all of 0x40d000..0x40fa00 first and give the real size; the lead's go before porting. The port's main menu does not bind `STANDALONE` (nothing to press, no crash): bind it when this lands. The pilot file keeps its record whole meanwhile.
8. **Multiplayer**: PM's game types (Mw3 dev has multiplayer).
   Left, from other pieces: a multiplayer game's jet keys are gated by its own +0xa7 (vt+0x44, 0x4365f0), the port has no
   such field and reads the player's option; `mp_lobby`'s missing-world box still uses MW3's message 0xfe0 (`pirates-moon.md`).

The `mw3pm` program, its own mount of PM's install and its own settings
and saves come with step 1: two programs, `mw3` and `mw3pm`, over one
engine, started from the launcher or directly (docs/games-layout.md).

## Load limits (0x004e2e30, 2026-11-06)

A targets.zrd entry's `load_limit` and `footfall_anim` (only `sbrg01`, `sbrg02`, c1m5: 50 tons, `sbridge_woggle01`, `02`), kept in
the target's description (0x004e2730: +0xf0, +0xf4 by name, 0x00524b50). Mech::Update (0x0041ae00), on the ground, takes the planted
foot's ground record (contact 1, 4 or 6), its node's target (id bit 21; 0x0040f670, so not a trap) and calls this with the mech.
Only mechs: nothing else calls it, so tanks crossing put no weight on a bridge. With the target active: the last call's weight
(+0x100) at or under the limit halves the stress (+0x104), over it adds weight/limit; past 10 vt+0x78 runs (0x004e2f20: the destroy
anim, then vt+0x80, the kill: the triggers fire, so `bridge_1_down` or `bridge_2_down`, the second failing the mission's
secondary objective). +0x100 then takes this mech's weight (vt+0x8c, 0x00486830, the chassis's tons, not the loadout's). Then the
footfall anim, every call (vt+0x58 is a mech's own self). The test of the frame against +0x108 always passes, nothing writing it.
Two mechs on it each see the other's weight, not the sum. `CZAiTarget::stood_on`, `load_step`; `test_pm_bridge.py`.
