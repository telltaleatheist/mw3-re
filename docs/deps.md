# The bundled libraries, from source

`tools/deps/build_deps.sh mac|linux` builds the libraries the releases
bundle from their official release tarballs (Owen, 2026-10-30: universal
arm64 + x86_64 for macOS 12 and later on the Mac, and on Linux), into
`build-deps/<platform>/prefix`. **Not run yet**: this session's permission
rules refused building downloaded code; the user allows it (a permission
rule) or runs it.

The signatures were checked once, when the pins were made (2026-10-30, a
throwaway GnuPG home); the script then checks each download's sha256 and
refuses a mismatch.

What is built:
- **SDL3**: shared, no tests or examples.
- **FreeType** 2.13.2 (the version SDL3_ttf 3.2.2 vendors), static and
  position-independent, inside SDL3_ttf, with none of its optional
  libraries (zlib, bzip2, PNG, HarfBuzz, Brotli): the game's TrueType fonts
  need none. SDL3_ttf's release tarball does not carry its vendored
  libraries (its `external/download.sh` clones them unpinned), so the
  signed FreeType release stands in.
- **SDL3_ttf**: shared, without HarfBuzz (complex-script shaping) or
  PlutoSVG (SVG fonts). Instead of Homebrew's seven extra libraries
  (FreeType, HarfBuzz, GLib, libintl, PCRE2, graphite2, libpng; two LGPL),
  none.
- **SDL3_sound**: shared, every default decoder.
- **FFmpeg**: LGPL 2.1, shared, only what mw3import uses (the AVI demuxer,
  the Indeo 5 decoder, the MPEG-1 video encoder and muxer, swscale, the file
  protocol). On the Mac each architecture is configured and built apart
  (x86_64 cross-compiled, without its hand-written assembly) and the dylibs
  joined with `lipo`; install names `@rpath`.
