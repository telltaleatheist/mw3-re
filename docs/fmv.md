# zFMV: the movie scripts

`C:\zipper\GameZMech3\zFMV\fmv_script.cpp` (0x00598cc0..0x0059a530) runs the
named scripts of `fmv.zrd` (in `reader.zbd`): a list of actions played one
after another, the images, waits, fades, blurs and sounds around the AVI
movies. `fmv_stream.cpp` (0x0059a4a0..0x0059b040) is the AVI player
(Video for Windows and Indeo 5), `fmv_main.cpp` (0x0059b040..) the MCI movie.
Ported: `src/gamez/zfmv/fmv_script.{h,cpp}` and `fmv_stream.{h,cpp}`, the
blur passes in `src/gamez/zrender/zrndr_blur.{h,cpp}`, and the program's side
in `src/mech3/app_fmv.cpp` and `app_movie.{h,cpp}` (the imported movies,
section 6). PLAYMCI is not ported (no script uses it).

## 1. Who plays what

| Caller | Block | When |
|---|---|---|
| Intro state 0x00482070 / 0x00482170 | `INTRO` | at start, with movies on (not `-nofmv`, not the lobby flow) |
| Intro state 0x00482170 | `SPLASH` | after it, always (not the lobby flow) |
| Attract state 0x00482330 | `ATTRACT` | 60 idle seconds in the main menu (0x00486d40) |
| Pilot menu 0x0048b0b6 | `campaign` | a new campaign's first pilot |
| Load state 0x004099da (0x00409320) | `c<op>m<n>` | before a campaign mission's briefing, when the briefing has one (0x0040a820) |
| Win movie state 0x0047a9b0 | `c4win` | the campaign's end (`c1win`..`c3win` are never played) |

Each makes the script (new(0x20), 0x00598cc0(0, 0, 0)), gives it the main
window (+4), loads the block (0x00598d80 with "fmv.zrd") and, when that is
not -1, plays it (0x005996d0); then polls 0x00599710 each frame until it is
false, rewinds it (0x00599750(0): back to the first action, the current one
not ended) and deletes it (0x00598d00).

`UNLOAD` (the mech3unload image), `DEMO_INTRO` (three logos faded in, blurred
and faded out to a sound, then the splash), `DEMO_EXIT` (the splash and the
`demoexit` image at 110, 260) and `DEMO_SPLASH` are left from the demo: no
code in 1.2 names them. Nor does any block use BLURH, BLURV or PLAYMCI.

## 2. The script and its load

The object: +0 FMV_PATH (strdup'd), +4 the window (0: [0x00608f80], the main
one), +8 the start time (a double), +0x10 the first action, +0x14 the last,
+0x18 the current one.

0x00598d80 (ECX script; file, block): zReader's tree of the file (0x00556740;
none: -1, after the engine's empty report "Failed to find FMV definitions
(fmv.zrd)"), FMV_PATH strdup'd to +0, IMAGE_PATH given to zImage's
directories (0x00516f50), then the block found (0x005569e0; none: 0, the
tree leaked). Each entry must be a list (else the read stops and the load
answers 0: "Error in parsing fmv actions: file=%s, tag=%s", also empty); its
first item is the verb, compared in this order, case-sensitive:

| Verb | Items | Action |
|---|---|---|
| SHOWIMAGE | name [x y] | image, shown at once; at x, y with both, else stretched over the screen |
| BLITIMAGE | name x y | image, shown at once, at x, y (always reads both) |
| LOADIMAGE | name [x y] | image, drawn but not shown |
| WAIT | seconds | wait |
| FADEIN, FADEOUT | (r g b) seconds alpha | fade |
| PLAYAVI | name [flag] | movie `<FMV_PATH>\<name>`; the flag (default 1) streams the sound (section 5) |
| PLAYMCI | name | MCI movie (the window, the path) |
| BLUR, BLURH, BLURV | passes | one blur step of `passes` passes, both ways, along the rows, down the columns |
| PLAYSOUND | name | sound (the name strncpy'd into 0x32 bytes) |

An unknown verb is skipped. The answer is the number of entries. Values are
read as the words they are (an x given as 1.5 is its float's bits). FIX
(bug): a short entry (BLITIMAGE without x and y, a FADE without its values)
read past its list in the original; the port reads 0 there.

## 3. The run

0x005995b0 (play, at time t): with no current action, false. Else the
finish target goes on the 2D target (0x00558290 with 0x00576d80, d90, da0,
db0), the `FMV` sound set is loaded (0x0056f520), the keys are cleared
(0x0051a300), t is kept at +8 and the first action started at 0.

0x00599620 (poll, at time t): with no current action, false. If Space,
Escape, Enter or the keypad's Enter (DIK 0x39, 0x01, 0x1c, 0x9c, asked in that
order and only until one answers) is in any state (pressed, held, let go),
the current action is ended, every sound playing is stopped (0x0056eb10's
record to 0x0056f0a0, the record not freed) and the script ends: false.
Else the action steps at t less the start (a float: the x87 is at 24 bits
in play); when it is done it is ended and the next started at the same time.
True, also on the poll the last action ends (the next poll is false).

The time is timeGetTime() x 0.001f (0x005996d0, 0x00599710), at 24 bits:
seconds since Windows started, as a float. After about 4.6 hours of uptime
it steps in milliseconds, after 24 days in quarter seconds, so waits and
fades would stutter on a machine left on for weeks. The port's clock starts
with the game (the frame clock's FIX (B), fixes.md).

An action's slots: +0 its vtable, +4 the next. The base's (0x005c6130):
step false (0x00493110), start nothing (0x0040baf0), end nothing
(0x0049bfd0), and a run-to-end (0x00493120: its own clock 0x00575d30) that
nothing calls.

### Images (vtable 0x005cf850)

+8 the name, +0xc the image, +0x10 shown at once, +0x11 placed, +0x14 a
rect. Placed (0x00599760): x, y and two words of a static never set (0).
Not placed (0x00599820): 0, 0 and the render target's size (0x00558080) at
load time. Start (0x00599930): the image by name (0x005179d0). Step
(0x00599950): once in software, twice in Direct3D; each time, a placed image
(or any in mode 2) through the locked 2D buffer (0x00576de0, 0x0055b1f0 at
x, y, 0x00576e70), else the whole image stretched over the rect
([0x0072f360] = 0x005773e0, a DirectDraw Blt onto the 2D surface
[0x008027e8]); shown (0x00576ea0(0, 0, 1, 1)) when shown at once. Done at
once. End (0x005999d0): released (0x00517b10).

LOADIMAGE does not show its image: the next flip that copies the 2D surface
does (0x0057a850's blit). In SPLASH that is the WAIT's end, so the logos
appear as the 4 seconds end, while the main menu loads, and the wait shows
what the screen held before (the intro movie's last frame, or black with
`-nofmv`). Not yet checked on the original (Owen's PC).

### The wait (vtable 0x005cf820)

+8 seconds, +0xc the start (a float). Start (0x0059a460): t as a float. Step
(0x0059a470): t below start + seconds (a float sum). End (0x0059a490): the
2D surface shown (0x00576ea0(0, 0, 1, 1)).

### Fades (vtable 0x005cf868)

0x005999f0: +8 out (0 FADEIN, 1 FADEOUT), +0xc the colour (0x00579370 of
the r, g, b bytes), +0x10 seconds, +0x24 alpha. Start (0x00599a40): the
screen grabbed (0x00579500(1)) at +0x20, t at +0x18. Step (0x00599ab0):
without a grab, done. f = (t - start) / seconds; a fade in uses 1 - f and
ends at 0 or below (NaN too), a fade out ends past 1. The grab drawn whole
(Direct3D: in the 3D lock 0x00576d00 / 0x00576d60; software: the 2D lock),
the colour over it at alpha x f (0x00558540), then in Direct3D the quad
(0x00579af0, [0x0072f3ec], 0x00579b10) and a flip without the copy, in
software the finish (0x00558610), the unlock and the flip with it. End
(0x00599be0): the grab released through zImage (0x00517b10). The fade state
(game-loop.md) is the same drawing on the frame's time.

### Blurs (vtables 0x005cf898, 0x005cf808, 0x005cf7f0)

0x00599f70(steps, passes): +8 steps, +0xc passes; the loader gives 1 step.
Start (0x00599f90): +0x10 a rect of the screen's size (0x00576cb0,
0x00576cc0), +0x20 one of the 2D target's (0x00576d90, 0x00576da0); in
Direct3D the finish target on the 2D target at the screen's size and the
picture copied from the back buffer to the 2D surface ([0x0072f358]), in
software on the renderer's buffer (0x00576ca0, 0x00576cd0) and copied back
([0x0072f35c]). Step (0x0059a070 both, 0x0059a100 along, 0x0059a190 down):
a step less; `passes` passes (0x0055a540 with EDX 3, 1, 2) in the 2D lock
(Direct3D) or the 3D lock and then the copy (software); shown with the copy;
done when no steps are left. End (0x0059a040): the finish target back on
the 2D target. 0x00599a70 runs one to its end; the pause screen does that
with a stack blur of 4 steps of 1 pass (0x00493040), so the battlefield
behind the pause menu softens over four frames before the menu grabs it.

FIX (A): the program has one 2D buffer, so the copies are nothing to do and
the blur works on the buffer in place (app_fmv.cpp).

### Sounds (vtable 0x005cf7d8)

+8 the sound, +0xc the voice, +0x10 the name. Start (0x00599d10): found by
name (0x0056f6f0), the last voice stopped (0x0056e9f0), played at volume 1
(0x0056e3d0). Done at once, the sound left playing.

### Movies (vtable 0x005cf880)

0x00599c00: +8 the path `<FMV_PATH>\<name>` (calloc'd), +0xc the flag (the
sound streamed). When `_stat` does not find it the exe looks for it on a
CD-ROM drive (0x00575d40 with ECX 5) and copies the found path over its
own; without one the path is freed and the movie ends at once (step
0x00599de0 is false without a path). FIX (A): the drives are not searched
(protection.md, the disc check): the movies are the importer's (section 6),
"found" when their `.fmv` is mounted.

Start (0x00599ea0): the stream (new(0x1e4), 0x0059a4a0, section 5), a rect
of the render target's size (0x00558080) at +0x24, the frame at -1. Step
(0x00599de0): the first step's time is the movie's start; the frame is
ftol((t - start) x fps) (the x87 at 24 bits); only when it changes, the
stream shows its frame (0x0059aaf0, which with sound takes the sound's
frame instead), stretched over the rect ([0x0072f360] with the stream as
the image) and flipped. Mode 2 decodes outside the 2D lock and flips without
the copy (0x00576ea0(0, 0, 1, 0)); the other modes decode inside it and
flip with it. Done when the stream answers 0 (past its last frame). End
(0x00599f40): the stream deleted. The destructor (0x00599d80) frees only
the path: a movie whose script is rewound and deleted without its end keeps
its stream, and the sound buffer loops on (kept).

PLAYMCI (vtable 0x005cf8b0, 0x0059a220): an MCI movie in the window, played
at start (0x0059b080), its end grabs and clears the screen (0x0059a3d0). No
block uses it; the port's ends at once.

## 4. The blur passes

0x0055a540 (ECX rect or null, EDX kind): 1 along the rows (0x0055a3b0), 2
down the columns (0x0055a1b0), else both (0x00559ec0), on the finish target
([0x0072c1e4], width [0x0072c1e8], height [0x0072c1ec], pitch in pixels
[0x0072c1f4]) through the ripple's scratch ([0x0072c1e0], rows of the
target's width). Each pixel becomes (a + b + 2c) / 4 of its two neighbours
and itself per channel: green under its mask, red and blue together under
theirs (0x00579280's masks; the sums cannot carry into the next channel).

- Along: rows from the rect's top (at least 0) to its bottom, pixels from
  its left (at least 1) to its right less one. Each row is blurred into the
  scratch and copied back at once, so the next row's left neighbour is
  already blurred.
- Down: rows from the top (at least 1) to the bottom less one, every column
  of the rect, into the scratch, then copied back. The rows above and below
  are a scratch width away, not a pitch.
- Both: down into the scratch (the row above copied first, the bottom row
  last), then along back onto the target, each row's two end pixels copied.

Quirk: the passes step from row to row by the width less the pitch after
each row's pixels, not by the pitch. On the whole of a target as wide as its
pitch that lands on the next row; with a rect narrower than the target (the
along pass always: it does two pixels fewer) each "row" starts where the last
ended, so the pass runs over the buffer as one line and mixes the ends of the
rows. Nothing in the game blurs a rect.

## 5. The movie player (fmv_stream.cpp)

The stream (new(0x1e4)) starts with an image header the 2D blits take: +0
the bytes, +4 / +6 the width and height, +0x10 the pixels, +0x34 the width.
+0x38 the path. 0x0059a4a0: AVIFileInit, then the sound, then the picture.

The picture (0x0059a650): AVIStreamOpenFromFileA('vids'), the format
(AVIStreamReadFormat, its size asked first), the length, the stream info.
The decompressor's output is the input BITMAPINFOHEADER (at least 0x6c
bytes) at the 2D surfaces' depth (0x00576c70), BI_BITFIELDS with the
display's masks (0x00579280) unless 24-bit, top down (the height negated).
The read buffer is the frame's bytes, or the stream's suggested buffer size.
ICLocate('vidc', the handler, ..., ICMODE_DECOMPRESS) and
ICM_DECOMPRESS_BEGIN; +0xec the frames a second (rate / scale), +0xf0 the
milliseconds a frame (rounded). A failure leaves (AVIFileExit) with nothing
open.

The sound (0x0059a900): AVIStreamOpenFromFileA('auds'), its WAVEFORMAT and
info. Streamed (PLAYAVI's flag, 1 unless given): a buffer of two halves of
the stream's suggested buffer size each (88,216 bytes for INTRO and C1,
22,054 for the rest: about a second), the first half read now, made a zSound
stream (0x005758c0); +0x1dc the samples read. Not streamed: the whole sound
read and made one buffer.

A frame (0x0059aaf0): with sound, the frame is the sound's (0x0059ad70);
else the one asked. Below the length: the frames to it caught up
(0x0059ae50); then, if that did not reach it, AVIStreamRead of that frame and
ICDecompress, not a key frame (0x08000000) unless AVIStreamFindSample(...,
FIND_PREV | FIND_KEY) says it is one. The answer is the next frame, 0 once
past the last (the end).

The sound's frame (0x0059ad70): the first call plays the buffer (0x0056e3d0)
and answers 0. A whole sound always answers 0, so its picture stays on the
first frame (no script asks for one). Streamed: from the play cursor
(0x00575690), when the half to refill next is the second and the cursor is
back in the first half, the second half is read (0x0059ac40); when it is the
first and the cursor is in the second half, the first. The frame is (the
samples read, less two halves, or three just after the first half's refill,
plus the cursor's samples) x fps / the sample rate, unsigned: with the cursor
still at 0 on the first poll after the start the frame is huge, the end.

The refill (0x0059ac40): the buffer's part locked (0x00575550), the samples
read into it at +0x1dc, which then moves on; unlocked (0x00575600). Quirk
kept: a lock that wraps (two pieces) moves the count by the first piece's
samples for the second too; the halves never wrap.

The catch-up (0x0059ae50): when the next key frame after the frame asked for
is that frame or the one after it, that key frame is decoded instead (so it
shows a frame early; INTRO's frames are all key frames). Else, past frames
skipped since the last decoded, they are decoded from the key frame before
(or the last decoded, if later), with ICDECOMPRESS_HURRYUP (and NOTKEYFRAME
from the last decoded), up to the frame before.

The program's side (FIX (A)): the Video for Windows calls go to the
zfmv::Host, which reads the importer's files (section 6, `app_movie.cpp`):
AVIStreamReadFormat and AVIStreamInfoA give the AVI's own format and
headers, AVIStreamFindSample its key frames, AVIStreamRead of the sound its
own PCM bytes (silence past the end) and of the picture which frame
ICDecompress then gives: pl_mpeg decodes the MPEG-1 picture to that frame
(MPEG frame 2n), converted to the 16-bit display format. The zSound stream is
the ported one (zsnd_create.cpp) on the platform's sound buffer, so the
sound's play cursor sets the frame as on Windows. With `--nosound` the
silent output's cursor moves with the clock (platform/silent_sound.h).

## 6. The imported movies

`mw3import` (tools/import, built when FFmpeg's libraries are found) writes,
for each `video\*.AVI` of the install, into the write dir's `video` folder
(never the repo):

- `<name>.m1v`: the picture, an MPEG-1 video stream at 30 fps, each source
  frame twice (MPEG-1 has no 15 fps rate code; 23.976 is its lowest),
  exactly 2 x dwLength frames, intra every 30, no B-frames, quantiser 2.
  Packets the Indeo decoder gives no picture for (its "drop" frames) repeat
  the picture before. pl_mpeg (third_party/pl_mpeg, MIT) decodes it by
  count, so its rate code never matters.
- `<name>.wav`: the AVI's sound stream byte for byte, its strf (the
  WAVEFORMAT) as the fmt chunk.
- `<name>.fmv`: text, a line each:
  - `fmv 1`
  - `avih <us per frame> <frames> <suggested buffer> <width> <height>`
  - `video vids <handler> <flags> <priority> <language> <initial frames>
    <scale> <rate> <start> <length> <suggested buffer> <quality>
    <sample size> <rcFrame left top right bottom>`: the strh, as
    AVIStreamInfoA gives it (a FOURCC of NULs is `-`, a space `_`)
  - `videof <bytes>`: the strf (the BITMAPINFOHEADER) in hex
  - `audio auds ...` and `audiof <bytes>`: the same for the sound
  - `keys <n> <frame> ...`: the video frames idx1 flags AVIIF_KEYFRAME

The 19 movies of the install convert in about a minute (INTRO to 60 MB from
82 MB). c3m3 and c1win..c3win are on the disc only (frontend-plan.md
section 3). The `.fmv` is written last, so its presence marks a movie done;
`--missing` converts only the movies without one, and prints `progress K N
name` after each. The `.fmv` is written in binary mode, so a Windows-made
set is the Mac's (the `.m1v` alone differ, by FFmpeg build).

**The first run** (ours, FIX (A); `frontend/sdl/first_run_import.cpp`): on a
plain start (not `--hidden`, `--frames`, `--shot`, a chain, a debug start or
`-nofmv`) mw3 compares the install's `video\*.AVI` with the write dir's
`.fmv` files. With some missing and `mw3import` in mw3's own folder, it runs
`mw3import --missing` (SDL's process API) and shows a small window with a
bar and "converting the movies (K of N)" in its title, about a minute for
the 19 (59 s on the Mac). Closing the window stops it (the done ones are
kept; the next start does the rest). A failed run leaves
`video\import-failed`, so later starts do not try again unless `--import`;
`--no-import` skips it. Without the importer the game plays without movies,
as it did.

**The Indeo helper** (ours, FIX (A); Windows): the install's own codec,
`Ir50_32.dll`, is a 32-bit Video for Windows driver (it exports DriverProc
and imports only WINMM, KERNEL32, USER32, GDI32, ADVAPI32 and ole32), which
64-bit mw3 cannot load and Windows 11 no longer registers. `mw3indeo.exe`
(tools/indeo, built 32-bit by `tools\windows\build_indeo.cmd`) loads it
from the install and calls its DriverProc itself, as the ICM layer does
(DRV_LOAD, DRV_ENABLE, DRV_OPEN with an ICOPEN for decompression, then
ICM_DECOMPRESS_QUERY, _BEGIN and ICM_DECOMPRESS with the player's flags):
no registry, no administrator. (Installed with ICInstall's
ICINSTALL_FUNCTION and opened through MSVFW32 instead, it crashed on Windows
11 in ICM_GETINFO, 0x5002, most likely as the codec's DRV_OPEN without an ICOPEN returns
its configure instance 0xffff0000, and the messages after it read that as
the instance, [0xffff0008].) The AVI comes from Windows' own AVIFIL32:
AVIStreamOpenFromFile, ReadFormat, Info, Length, Read and FindSample, each
call one message over its stdin and stdout
(`platform/vfw_protocol.h`). So the picture is the codec's own, as the
original showed it, decoded while the movie plays (nothing converted or
stored). mw3 starts it at start-up when `mw3indeo.exe` is beside `mw3.exe`
and the install has `Ir50_32.dll` (or `--vfw-helper EXE`;
`--no-vfw-helper` skips it) and prints `movies through the Indeo helper`;
the first-run import then does not run. A helper that does not start,
lacks the codec or stops answering falls back to the importer's files
(`movies not through the Indeo helper (why)`), as before. On macOS there is
no 32-bit x86 to run the codec, so the movies stay the importer's (FFmpeg
from Homebrew, for developers).

Checked here: the pipe and the host's routing, through `mw3indeo_fake`
(tools/indeo), which answers the same messages from one imported movie:
`sdl_movies_through_the_indeo_helper_pipe` (mw3sdltests) compares each
call with the imported stream in-process, then plays c1m2 through the pipe,
through the files and with a helper that does not exist (the fallback): the
same 475 frames drawn and the same picture. The helper itself (the codec in
AVIFile) is checked on Windows with `mw3indeo --check` (docs/windows.md, The
Indeo helper).

**Music** (ours; `platform/cue_audio.h`): `mw3import --cue DISC.cue
[--music-only]` writes each AUDIO track of a disc image's cue sheet as the
write dir's `music\trackNN.wav` (CD audio as is: 44100 Hz, 16-bit
stereo), which the music player finds (sdl_music.cpp, CLAUDE.md's track N
rule). A track runs from its INDEX 01 (the pregap, INDEX 00 to 01, left
out) to the next track's start in the same file (its INDEX 00, else 01), or
to its file's end: Redump's one bin per track as well as one bin for all.
Pirate's Moon's track 2 (a 2 s pregap) is 562.8 s. A real CD drive is not
read. Test: mw3tests `cue_audio_writes_each_audio_track_from_index_01`.

## 7. Tests

`tests/differential/test_fmv.py` (probe `tests/probe_fmv.cpp`): every shipped
block named above and random blocks with every verb (short and bad entries,
unknown verbs) loaded from the same binary tree on both sides, played and
polled at random times in Direct3D, software and mode 2, skipped by a key,
rewound, replayed, left mid-way; every call out compared in order with its
arguments, and each poll's answer and current action. The pause screen's
blur (0x00599f70 run by 0x00599a70). The three passes bit for bit on random
screens (with the rows around the target the walk reads), scratch buffers,
pitches, rects and both 16-bit formats. Shots: `build/mw3 --nosound --hidden
--shot-any --shot-frame 3` is the SPLASH logos without the movies (frame 1 the
start-up's clear, 2 the INTRO wait's end).

The movie player: PLAYAVI found on random movies (length, frame rate, key
frames, sample size and rate, buffer size, the sound missing, any call
failing, a lock split in two, the play cursor jumping) in the shipped movie
blocks and random ones: every Video for Windows call, decompress (with its

The movies as played: `build/mw3 --nosound --hidden --write-dir <dir with the
imported movies> --movie NAME` plays the block on a clock that steps 1/60 s a
poll and reports the frames drawn and the last; every movie block draws
exactly its AVIs' dwLength frames, the last dwLength - 1 (c1m1: 870 + 690).
With `--shot FILE --shot-frame N` it saves the movie's N-th frame (from 1)
and quits; `--movie` skips the Intro state's own movies (the lobby flow).
Against FFmpeg's own decode of INTRO.AVI the shots are 37 to 42 dB (the 16-bit
display format and MPEG-1 at quantiser 2), each closest to the AVI's frame
after the one asked for: the catch-up's key frame one ahead (INTRO's frames
are all key frames).
