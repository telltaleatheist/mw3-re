# Work logs and the specialists' protocol

The lead session ("mw3 lead", formerly "mw3 mac 1") hands out one small
item at a time to the worker over SendMessage, reviews and merges its
branches. Since 2026-10-25 (Owen) one worker, "mw3 dev" (formerly "mw3 mac
4"), takes every area; the area specialists below are paused. The worker
keeps its log here, so it can pick up after a compaction by reading it.

| Session | Area | Log |
|---|---|---|
| mw3 dev | Every area, one item at a time (from 2026-10-25) | `dev.md` |
| mw3 dev 2 | Every area, one item at a time, alongside mw3 dev (from 2026-10-29; worktree mac5) | `dev2.md` |
| mw3 mac 4 (now mw3 dev) | The AI, to 2026-10-25: the brain, orders, behaviours, AI firing, lancemates; then render, vehicles, the cleanup | `ai.md` (history) |
| mw3 mac 2 (paused) | Game systems: mechs, movement, weapons, effects, the world's queries | `game.md` |
| mw3 mac 3 (paused) | Front end and presentation: fades, the HUD, screens, render glue | `frontend.md` |

## Rules for a specialist

- Read `CLAUDE.md` first; it holds the project's conventions.
- Run on Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`). Porting and analysis need it.
- Start no agents or subagents. The lead runs the reviews.
- Work in your own worktree, never in the main checkout. Set it up once:
  `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<session> -b <session>/<item>
  main`, with symlinks to the main checkout's `game/`, `analysis-output/`
  and `.venv/`, and your own `build/`. Then, for each item, run
  `git checkout -b <session>/<item> main` in that worktree.
- Keep scratch files in the worktree's `scratch/` folder, which is not
  tracked.
- Keep your context small:
  - Grep `analysis-output/decomp` and `mech3.asm` instead of reading whole
    files, and keep tool output short.
  - While iterating, run only the tests you touch.
  - Before reporting, run the related set, plus `mw3tests` and
    `mw3sdltests` (about 3 minutes: fine, Owen 2026-10-22). While
    iterating, `MW3_SKIP=headless ./build/mw3tests` runs the units in under
    a second, and `MW3_TEST=name` runs one test by name.
  - Keep each test run short (Owen, 2026-10-22: runs of 10 to 20+ minutes
    slowed the night down). Break runs are where the time went: each break
    reran a differential at its full count (lab step 5b2a: 28 breaks x 83 s
    for 60 runs, 20 minutes). Run a break at the smallest count that
    reaches its branch (10 to 20 runs, or the seeds known to reach it), and
    rerun at the full count only a break that the short run misses. Aim to
    keep a whole break pass under 5 minutes.
  - A differential that takes over 3 minutes at its default count runs at a
    reduced count in the related set; the full count runs at the lead's
    checkpoints (`tests/differential/run_all.sh`, in the background).
  - End emulator tests with `sys.stdout.flush(); os._exit(code)`: Unicorn
    processes can hang at exit on this Mac, in a state nothing can kill.
    Run long tests in the background with their output going to a file in
    `scratch/`, then read the file, so a hang never blocks the session.
  - Run every differential test, and every break run's test, under
    `tests/differential/run_capped.py --mem-gb 4 --secs <limit> -- <cmd>`
    (macOS ignores `ulimit -v`): it kills the run's process group over the
    memory cap (exit 125) or the time limit (124) and prints the peak. A
    test left alone once grew to 193 GB over 11 hours (2026-10-21).
  - After two failed attempts at the same fix or mismatch, stop retrying:
    go back to the assembly and the callers and work out what is really
    happening before the third try.
- Never kill processes by name (`pkill -f mw3tests` and the like): the
  other sessions run the same programs. Kill only a pid you started.
- A `CHANGES.md` line goes under its heading (bug fixes that change play,
  crashes, protection, modern machines), never at the end of the file: the
  last section lists what the rebuild keeps on purpose.
- Every item comes with a differential test with break tests, its docs,
  `fixes.md` and `CHANGES.md` lines for any change from the original, and
  player-facing finds in `discoveries.md`.
- Commit messages carry no `Co-Authored-By` or `Claude-Session` lines, and
  the author email is the noreply address set in the repo's git config.
- Commit on your branch and never push or merge to main. Report to "mw3
  lead" with SendMessage: the commits, what is ported (by address), the test
  results, the findings, the fixes and what is left. Keep the report short.
- Owen compacts each specialist after every major feature (`/compact`), so
  keep the log current enough to pick up from it alone.
- After reporting, append a few lines to your log (the item, its commits,
  and what you would need to remember), then wait for the next item.
