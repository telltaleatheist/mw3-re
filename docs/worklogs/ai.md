# AI log (mw3 mac 4)

Newest last. One short entry per item: what, commits, what to remember.

## 2026-10-20 Item 1: the brain map, the HUD's planner getters (mac4/brain-map)

- Map: ai.md section 17 (frame, order stack, behaviours and their states,
  the engage gate, steering, vlist triggers, radio and player orders,
  firing, switches, a 15-item porting order). The decompiler is unreliable
  in this range (lost `this`, broken switch fall-through, dropped returns):
  read mech3.asm. Helpers: scratch/asm.py (disassembly by address),
  scratch/pe.py (vtables, floats), scratch/calltree.py.
- Ported 0x4b1bd0 / 0x4b1c70 / 0x4b1cd0 (`mech3/weapon_planner`), test
  `test_weapon_planner.py` rides on test_weapons_run.py's managers; probe
  accessor `probe_wm_planner` added to mac 2's probe_weapons_run.cpp.
  FIX (bug): 0x4b1cd0's saved-ECX answer.
- Next in the order: the order stack (item 2). Order must become
  polymorphic (net part, state), the existing test_ai_brain compares the
  current Order layout: update it together.
- Noticed: 0x4e8380 popping the last order resumes through a null block
  (not reached by any caller seen).
