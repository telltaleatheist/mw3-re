## 2026-10-20 The fade state 0x0048eea0 (branch mac3/fade)

Commits 0c9787f, a0c690b. FadeState in app_states (fade_push / fade_replace,
0x0048ee70..0x0048f1b0); GameEngine::fade runs it; new Engine hooks
video_grab / image_draw / screen_tint / image_free, done on the program's
16-bit buffer. test_fade.py + probe_fade.cpp (17/17 breaks; the break script
pattern: mutate app_states.cpp, rebuild mw3probe, expect failure, restore).
Remember: the emulator's queue stubs don't call on_queued, the rebuild's push
does, so the test runs 0x48ef60 right after the entry; app_world stubs
0x48ee70 (deleted from e.slots in the test); print + flush before os._exit.
Left: the fade-out callers (their next states unported).
