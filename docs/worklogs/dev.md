# Work log: mw3 dev

The single worker session from 2026-10-25 (Owen), formerly "mw3 mac 4".
Its earlier log, the AI items and everything up to HUD plan item 1, is
`ai.md`; read its last sections for the state at the switch. The protocol
is in `README.md`.

## Queue at the switch (2026-10-25)

- Item 19, the weather: rain (c3, c4, t1) and snow (c4b m4 / m6), the
  manager's rect and tick (0x5a6790 / 0x5a67c0, renamed weather_rect /
  weather_tick), app_mission's create_rain / create_snow / weather_add.
  Rain first, snow second if it needs another sitting.
- Then `hud-plan.md` items 6-9: 0x40fac0 as one call, the mission maps
  (maps.zrd), the radar's map mode (Shift+R), the radar's polylines.
- Later: the front-end screens (campaign, Instant Action, the mech lab,
  briefing and debriefing, salvage, movies), planned the same way.

## Item 19: the weather, rain first (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (the lead): the weather base 0x5a5470 with rain 0x5a60a0 and
  snow 0x5a5ad0 (vtables 0x5d0528 / 0x5d0660 / 0x5d05e0), the manager's
  rect and tick (0x5a6790 / 0x5a67c0 renamed weather_rect / weather_tick),
  app_mission's create_rain / create_snow / weather_add, the frame order
  and blend; split rain (c3, c4, t1) and snow (c4b m4 / m6) if large; a
  differential of the update, breaks, headless on a rain world, a
  screenshot pair. Branch mac4/weather off main (now 8181f8d).
- Traced: the weather is a zTwoD object (Object2D, 0x98 bytes) on the
  manager [0x736328] (a Layer with two rect slots +0x10 / +0x14, the text
  target +0x18 and timed texts to +0x1ec). Its own slots: +0x00 dtor,
  +0x04 draw 0x5a5360 (+0x7c once per manager rect), +0x24 update (rain
  0x5a6110, snow 0x5a5b40 with 0x5a5e10), +0x7c the particles' draw
  0x5a57d0 (a quad each through draw_textured_white, the "SnowFX" 16x8
  ramp texture, clip test 0x5a5a60). Particles live in screen space and
  are re-randomized every frame (0x5a56e0); the streak is one frame's
  motion (gravity + wind - the camera's move, in camera space).
- Queue after it (Owen, via the lead, 2026-10-25: this session is the one
  working session, the lead reviews): snow (19b if split), then HUD plan
  items 6-9 in order (0x40fac0 as one call; maps.zrd; the radar's map
  mode; the polylines), then the front-end screens.
- Done 19a (rain): `ztwod/twod_weather` (base, rain, the overlay's rect and
  tick), the program's `ProgramWeather` and `GameEngine::weather_rect` /
  `weather_tick` (the rect by its number: render, display, window). Found
  on the way: the overlay layer is active from static init (0x5a4590's
  vt+4(1)) and holds its own hidden object and five texts; the streak is
  scaled to 0.1 only when |d|^2 > 0.01 (a short move is its own streak).
  FIXes: the first frame's unset size (bug), the zeroed ramp (A), the
  slant per frame rate (B, per_second). Tests: test_weather.py 400 cases
  (2 ulps / a pixel for fsin / fcos, 9 frames in 2,581), 13/13 breaks,
  mission_c4m2_rain_made_and_drawn_headless, a screenshot pair in
  claude-files/outbox/2026-10-25 (weather_c4m2_rain_on/off.png). Docs:
  weather.md, fixes, CHANGES, discoveries, symbols, twod, world-params,
  hud-plan item 5. Next: 19b, snow.

## Item 19b: the snow (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (the lead, after reviewing 19a): the snow 0x5a5ad0 (vtable
  0x5d05e0), its update 0x5a5b40 with 0x5a5e10, create_snow in app_mission;
  stacked on mac4/weather (19a being merged).
- Done 19b: `ztwod::Snow` (0x5a5ad0, update 0x5a5b40; Ghidra's 0x5a5e10 is
  its tail, not a function), the two updates' shared start as
  `Weather::motion` / `project`, a clock each (rain [0x73653c]/[0x736528],
  snow [0x736538]/[0x736518]), create_snow through `program_weather`.
  Snow keeps its places (reset only off the view: |y| or |x| > |z|, z > 1,
  !(z >= 0.5)); flakes ftol(3.5 k) pixels thick. The per_second FIX covers
  the snow's fall too. Tests: test_weather.py 400 cases (200 snow, 5,227
  frames; 8 ulps / 1e-7 of a place / a pixel, the snow's places synced each
  frame; 69 frames tolerated), 20/20 breaks, the two headless runs sharing
  run_weather_mission, a snow pair (weather_c4bm4_snow_on/off.png).

## HUD plan item 6: 0x40fac0 as one call (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (the lead): hud-plan.md items 6-9, one at a time, each branched
  off main. Item 6 on mac4/hud-frame off cdfe0f4.
- Done: `GameEngine::hud_update` is 0x40fac0 (the view target's frame, the
  message panel's update, the pocket commander; the developer lines,
  frame-rate text and console layers left out), app_states' hud() calls it
  alone. Found: the message panel's text had never been drawn (its update,
  vt+0x24, is 0x40fac0's); the c1m1 HUD test now checks it (break caught).
  WiredLaunch's mech_screen gives `pilot_hud`; hud_reset / hud_zoom hide or
  show the objectives. Noted for later (hud-plan item 6): the radar reset
  0x43d920, and app_states' `radar` / `ai_tick` are the HUD's 0x43cd20 and
  reticle update (`Engine::mech_ai` is 0x430aa0), still logged.

## HUD plan item 6b: the HUD's static and the zoom pass (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (the lead, from item 6's finding): app_states' radar() /
  ai_tick() are the HUD's: 0x43cd20 on the pilot's HUD and the reticle's
  (+0x144c) vt+0x28. Branch mac4/hud-static off main.
- Traced: 0x43cd20 is the HUD's screen static. Four channels (+0x22e08..
  +0x22e34: three static levels with a floor and a hold, and the radar's
  fade); with the lowest internal structure of the torso's three sections
  and the head under 0.4 (and GameIntensity's flag clear) it adds to a
  random one (0x43bfe0 kind 5: 0.1 a frame up to k / 4); each shown
  channel draws static (0x43cca0 -> 0x558c10: noise-table pixels under the
  level replaced by three greys); the levels decay 0.3 a second after
  their hold. The reticle's +0x28 is 0x444230 -> the zoom window's +0x28
  0x442f50 (its 3D pass, 198 lines): split off as 6c.
- Done 6b: `Hud::static_tick` / `add_static` / the draw (0x43cd20,
  0x43bfe0, 0x43cca0), `zrndr::finish_init` / `static_fill` (0x5581c0,
  0x558c10) and `GameEngine::render_reset` (0x557b20: the noise filled at
  start-up as the exe, 0x557b30 logged). The draw paths' calls renamed
  (`pilot_hud`, `hud_static`, `hud_zoom_pass`; the exe's call shapes kept as
  defaults), the mech's +0x684 written by WiredLaunch. FIXes: the 0.1 a
  frame (B, per_second), TARGET's null rect (bug), the table's spare byte
  (A). Tests: test_hud ops 39-41 (100 HUDs, 262 fills; the exe's null read
  hooked to the port's FIX), test_static.py (pixels), breaks. Next: 6c.

## HUD plan item 6d: c1m1's emplacements (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (the lead, before 6c): c1m1's "Completed: Destroy SRM
  Emplacement" lines at 00:00:01. Branch mac4/emplacements off main 0f23363.
- Found: the turrets are built (the ported loader, 14 in c1); the
  objectives' entity_find (0x4d7330) searched only the AI mechs and the
  targets, so every turret's and vehicle's destroy objective counted as
  destroyed at once. Fixed: turrets and vehicles by node name, their +0x08
  as the flag, labels through entity_name (vt+0xa4; a turret's is none).
  The c1m1 won/lost test checks the four emplacements alive and their
  objectives open, and kills them to win (break caught). Survey of every
  mission: all found but c2m3's firefly_01 / firefly_02 (the mission makes
  firefly_03 / 04): a data typo in the original, a candidate for Owen.

## c2m3's Firefly objectives (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (the lead, Owen approved): the data typo found in 6d as a FIX
  (bug). Done: `fix_objective_data` (mech_objective) after the read, keyed
  on c2 / m3, renames the two secondary destroy objectives to firefly_03 /
  04 and finds them again; objectives_load takes the mission's directory
  (null in the probes). fixes.md's Data typos, CHANGES, objectives.md,
  discoveries; mission_c2m3_firefly_objectives_open_headless (break
  caught). Next: 6c1.

## HUD plan item 6c1: the HUD's 3D views (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (the lead, the split): the views' nodes and render first. Branch
  mac4/hud-views off main 05a3b01.
- Done: zClass window_create / set_size / set_origin (0x4f9e90, 0x4f9fa0,
  0x4fa0b0) and camera_set_flag8 (0x4f34c0); Render3D::clear_depth_rect
  (a default) and zvid::depth_fill (0x576ce0 -> 0x577770's DEPTHFILL);
  ProgramHudHooks' node table and the camera / window hooks, zview_render
  through render_world (hardware only, as 0x4b52c0), dirty_rect as the
  depth fill. Test mission_c1m1_hud_views_drawn_headless (break caught).
  Open [Owen]: the MFD's mode 1 camera (0x442900 has no caller found).

## HUD plan item 6c2: the zoom window's 3D pass (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (the lead, the split): 0x442f50 with 0x4436c0, stacked on
  mac4/hud-views. Found: the zoom's zView is its own class (vtable
  0x5c0600): its render 0x443320 pushes the fog back for the pass; the
  zoom hides the player's own mech; the round window's corners are masked
  with four clear-texture fans at depth 0.99; the program never formatted
  zTwoD message texts (FormatMessage), so the zoom's range (and any other
  set_text_id text) was empty: SdlTwodHost::format_message.
- Tests: test_hud op 42 (100 HUDs, 75 passes, 120 fans), breaks,
  mission_c1m1_hud_zoom_drawn_headless.

## Playtest #23 / #24 / #28: firing, aim, recoil (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (the lead, Owen's second playtest): some clicks fire nothing
  until clicked again (#23), a laser does not land where the reticle was at
  the click (#24), no recoil (#28: WeaponCalls::recoil never set). Each with
  a headless check that reproduces it first. Branch mac4/playtest-firing
  off main.
- #28 fixed: `c.recoil` wired in app_weapons.cpp (an Arm kicks, a Hand
  passes it to its arm, other parts none). The Bushwhacker's LRM/AC group
  went from recoil 0 to 0.43 (mission_c1m1_arm_weapon_recoils_headless).
- #23 as the original: five clicks pressed and released inside one frame
  (mouse and key) all fire once the bar is full
  (mission_c1m1_short_clicks_fire_headless); a beam fires only from a full
  charge (0x4b3fc0), so clicks while it recharges are dropped. Buffering
  them is in fixes.md's candidates.
- #24 as the original: the beam fires at exactly the aim point the click
  saw, turning or not, and a held beam follows the reticle
  (mission_c1m1_laser_{lands,turning}_on_the_reticle_headless; a sideways
  1 m aim error fails both). A trap on the way: at 80 m the reticle's ray
  passes 0.9 m beside the Owens' torso (its AI turns it about 12°) and
  hits the building behind, while the arm's beam still crosses the Owens.
  Test helpers mech_group_ammo / _ready / _muzzle, mech_arm_recoil.
## Playtest #25: LRMs lock but don't home (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (the lead): in the original, lock, aim at the sky, fire, and the
  missiles climb and come down on the target; here they fly straight.
  Branch mac4/playtest-lrm off main. Lead: the program never wires
  WeaponCalls' lock hooks (entity_target, record_target, target_position,
  target_velocity, target_mech), so Weapon::try_lock (0x4b3330) finds no
  target and the shot spawns without one.
- Fixed: app_weapons wires entity_target (+0x6c), record_target (the
  contact's object), target_mech, target_position (app_sensors
  weapon_lock_point: 0x5a8630's live pointer into the target node),
  target_velocity (weapon_lock_velocity: a mech's 0x41d480 into the new
  Mech::lock_velocity +0x64c, a vehicle's live +0x30), ecm_count, fcs_count,
  equipment_in_part, lock_notice (mech_lock_warning, 0x41abd0). The
  missiles now spawn with the lock and home (traced: target_at follows the
  Owens). LRM5's TURN_RATE 0.25 (rad/s, as the exe reads it) means 10
  degrees off at 150 m hits and 22 does not; the test fires 10 degrees off,
  and fails without the wiring (record_target null: no hit).
- Open: what drops an in-flight shot's lock when its target goes.
- Test isolation: in the full suite the LRM test's E did nothing after
  campaign_menus_to_c1m1_through_the_briefing_headless (bisected). The
  player controls ([0x6056ec]) survived that test, so 0x427280 did not
  register the command callbacks again on the new zInput map each test's
  init makes (E is a callback command; throttle and fire are polled).
  reset_process_state now clears the instance, as a new process has none.
  The program makes zInput once, so play is not affected.

## Playtest #27: shots don't destroy c1m1's missile turrets (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (lead): shots at the c1m1 missile turrets don't destroy them.
  Branch mac4/playtest-turrets, off mac4/playtest-lrm (the #25 hooks).
- Plan: a headless repro firing at a tur_* node; follow the hit from the
  segment query to Turret::hit and the deactivation at health 0.
- Not reproduced headless. Projectiles from 60 m at the centroid kill all
  four SRM emplacements in two PPC hits each (healthy off, destroyed on);
  the Mad Cat with its reticle pitched onto tur_srm04 kills it with its
  lasers in three volleys. Probes found: the node origin is the turret's
  base (shots at it hit the ground); tur_srm02 is inside rktun01, whose
  walls take shots along x; teleporting the player outside c1m1's area
  sets outside_c1m1 (lose(), the debriefing 8 s later), so probes stay in
  bounds; CountingPump's limit counts passes, not frames.
- Tests: mission_c1m1_shots_destroy_the_srm_turrets_headless,
  mission_c1m1_player_destroys_an_srm_turret_headless; break (no hit
  callback set): health stays 1.000, both fail.
- Asked the lead for Owen's case (turret, weapon, what he saw).

## Playtest #26: F12's objectives box has no text (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (lead): F12 opens the objectives box with no text; its filler
  0x446ad0 (HudObjectives, from show_for 0x446820) is unported. Branch
  mac4/playtest-objbox off main 6ba7b85.
- Ported 0x446ad0 (HudObjectives::fill) with 0x446930 (its vt+0x7c, a blank
  score per line: without it the "In Progress" column sat beside the
  header), 0x446970, 0x446a20 and 0x45e080 (the "  OP: <nav>" suffix).
  ProgramHudHooks::objectives_source gives mission_objectives(), +0x56,
  the campaign's operation and mission; nav names and keys' names too. The
  objective hooks now give the cockpit (program_mech_hud) and refill the
  box on a completion (0x45e110). Screenshot via the new dev option
  `build/mw3 --objectives N`.
- Test mission_c1m1_objectives_box_text_headless; breaks: no fill (no
  lines), no blank score (columns differ). FIX (bug): the texts go in as
  "%s" arguments (fixes.md; no shipped text has a '%').

## Playtest #23/#24 reopened: the click and the beam's start (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (lead, Owen's words): a charged, ready weapon does not fire on a
  click, only when the mouse button is held; and when the laser leaves the
  arm the mech has moved on but the beam starts where the mech was at the
  click. Check the real SDL mouse path (buffered vs state, which frame the
  edge is read, a press seen only while still down), time press -> fire in
  frames, and whether the beam's origin (+0x40 muzzle) is taken at the
  press and not refreshed at the spawn. Branch mac4/playtest-click.
- Repro tools (ours): `build/mw3 --mission c1m1 --walk --fire-group G
  --click N:M` pushes real SDL mouse events (SDL_PushEvent) at frames N / M
  and logs each frame's dt, the manager's trigger and state, the beam and
  how far its origin is from the firepoint now; `--walk` presses
  THROTTLE0. Test sdl_program_mouse_click_fires_the_laser feeds SdlInput
  the same events.
- Found: no press delay. In the live program (~110 fps) every group (MGUN,
  small, medium, large lasers, LRM20) fires on the frame after the press
  event (the press frame's poll), ready or not shown at 1.00 before.
- Found: the stale beam. A short laser keeps firing after the button is let
  go until its charge drains (release 0x4b4180 stops only fire_time > 0.5),
  and its muzzle is re-aimed only on the trigger (0x4b3f40) and the held
  frames (0x4b41b0); BeamWeapon's update (0x4b4230) does not aim. Walking
  at full speed the beam's origin trails the firepoint by 0.17 m a frame
  after the release, 1.4 m by the beam's end (ERLaser_Medium, ~140 ms).
  The exe's only aim callers are 0x4b2d2d (projectile update), 0x4b36b0,
  0x4b3f6b, 0x4b41d9: the same in the original.
- Fixed (bugs): BeamWeapon::update re-aims a firing beam each frame (the
  held path's aim), so the beam leaves from the arm after a click. The SDL
  test runs both paths: fixed 0.00 m, the original 1.28 m behind; the live
  program likewise (0.00 m over frames 404..415).
- "Has to hold it to fire" not reproduced: every press fires on its frame.
  Fits the original's rules: a click before the charge is completely full
  does nothing (0x4b3fc0) and a hold fires the moment it is; in chain fire
  a click fires only the current weapon. Asked for Owen's case.

## Playtest #22: ground textures blink (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (lead): the ground's textures blink in play. Branch
  mac4/playtest-blink off main 0e5ee80.
- Tools (ours): `build/mw3 --shot F.bmp --shot-frame N --shot-series K`
  writes the K frames before N as F_<frame>.bmp; `--tap DIK@N[:M]` presses
  a key as an SDL event (X 0x2d for the outside view, Left 0xcb to turn);
  tools/analysis/blinks.py marks pixels that differ from both neighbouring
  frames while those agree.
- Not reproduced: c1m1 still (water and shore animate, a mast, birds),
  walking in the cockpit (the frame's edges bob, birds), outside still (0
  px) and turning; c1m2 still (a parked vehicle's edges flicker: its
  model's faces, not the ground); c2m1 still (0-1 px). Code: D32 float
  reversed depth from the game's sz, cycled vertex uploads, no texture
  eviction in zRender or Render3D. Questions to Owen through the lead.

## Playtest #29: the MFD's three modes, the mode-1 camera with 6c3 (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (lead): the MFD's mode-1 camera caller (MFD vt+0x8c, 0x442900)
  with hud-plan 6c3 (TARGET's object view 0x4428b0); check all three D
  modes against Owen's description (1 the own mech in 3D from the front,
  2 the parts damage diagram, 3 the armour bar graph, green, red where
  damaged), a screenshot each. Branch mac4/playtest-mfd off
  mac4/playtest-blink (its --tap).
- Found the "caller": 0x442900 is no MFD slot but the MFD view's zView's
  render: 0x442620 sets the view's +0x34 vtable to 0x5c04f8, whose +0x04 is
  0x442900 (the plain zView 0x5c9118 has 0x4b52c0). It puts the camera 13 m
  before the mech (local -z) at 1.25 x the centroid's height and draws the
  mech alone (0x4428b0). Ported in ProgramHudHooks (zview_render dispatches
  on HudMfdView; mfd_view; view_draw_node for 0x4428b0, also TARGET's 6c3).
- Screenshots: mode 1 the Mad Cat from the front, 2 the parts diagram,
  3 the armour bars; Owen's description. Pitfall: a reused --write-dir keeps
  the view option a --tap of X set (the next runs start outside).
- Found and fixed a crash: zutl::format_message_v read every %N as a string,
  so the radar's nav line 0x229 "OP: %1 [%2!d!m]" crashed with the nav point
  under 1 km. It now reads each by its !type! (msgdll_formats_each_argument_by_its_type).
- Test mission_c1m1_mfd_shows_the_mech_and_target_its_target_headless;
  break: the MFD view as a plain zView (camera at the origin, no node).

## Playtest #30 / HUD plan item 9: the radar's boundary lines (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (lead): no mission boundaries (yellow and red lines) on the
  radar; the radar's polylines (hud-plan item 9, needs zTwoD's PolyLine).
  Branch mac4/playtest-radar off main f5e2ecf.
- The polylines are the mission boundary, not the nav route: 0x43d920 (the
  mission start's, 0x491696) takes the player's settings' vlist regions
  reg_inside_ (0x4d92f0) and reg_outside_ (0x4d9360), counts their corners,
  colours them yellow (c3,ad,03) and red. The draw (0x43dd00 step 5) was
  already ported. Ported the reset (HudRadar::reset_boundary) and the
  program's hooks (radar_boundary, radar_point_count, radar_point); the
  launch's hud_43d920 finds the player's HUD (its handle is truncated).
- Survey: shipped boundaries have 6..12 corners (a polyline holds 21, the
  radar writes count + 1): no overflow. Screenshot: c1m1's radar shows both
  lines just south of the start.
- Test mission_c1m1_radar_shows_the_boundary_headless; break: no region.

## HUD plan items 7-8: the mission maps and the radar's map mode (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (lead): item 7, the mission maps (0x4583b0 and family: maps.zrd
  read at the start, freed at the end); item 8, the radar's map mode (the
  map drawn under the contacts, Shift+R). Branch mac4/hud-maps off
  mac4/playtest-radar.
- Ported the map family into mech3/mission_map (mech_map.cpp's): the map
  class 0x4580c0 (an Image), the read 0x4583b0, load/unload, find 0x458590,
  pick 0x4582a0 ("large", else the first loaded), point 0x4586e0. Wired the
  startup read and exit free (GameEngine maps_init / mech_data_shutdown),
  the cleanup's 0x4582c0, the briefing's pick into missions +0xbc (and the
  debug start's, ours), the HUD's map hooks and 0x491c80.
- Test mission_c1m1_maps_and_the_radar_map_mode_headless (image stand-ins:
  the headless zTwoD host loads none). Live: Shift+R draws c1m1_small in the
  radar's box with the mech's circle at its pixel.
- Break: the briefing's pick not stored: no map at the start (c1m1 expected).
  With Shift+R on too, that run crashes at the quit's cleanup instead:
  zsnd::snapshot calls out()->get_status for a dup voice while the headless
  test's zSound has no output (hooks().output null). Open, test-only: the
  headless runs give zSound no output; a dup appears once Shift+R plays
  over an empty mission map.
- The full suite first crashed in the new test: its image stand-ins
  answered every name while the maps' path was set (a world texture with
  no fields scrolled); now only the maps' bitmaps. And the maps' read flag
  outlived a test (0x4584e0 keeps it, as the exe); reset_process_state
  clears the maps as a new process has none.

## Front-end census and plan, docs/frontend-plan.md (2026-10-25)

- Assigned (lead): a census and plan like hud-plan.md. The campaign loop as
  a player sees it (main menu, pilot, campaign / Operation screen, briefing,
  mission, debriefing, salvage, mech lab, next mission, save and load), then
  Instant Action setup, training and the movies; per screen its object and
  state, what is ported, what runs now (live), what is missing, the size;
  a porting order in small items, the campaign loop first (c1m1 -> c1m2
  with salvage and the lab), each with a test plan. For review before item
  1. Also: the c1m2 parked vehicle's edge flicker (#22) as an open render
  note. Branch mac4/frontend-plan off main 78b1f9b.
- Wrote docs/frontend-plan.md: the loop's screens with their ports and
  sizes, IA, training, the movies, a porting order of 13 items (salvage
  first). Live through the menus with a new driver in mw3_main (ours):
  `--click-at X,Y@N` (game pixels, zInput's 0x51b440), `--tap`, `--shot`
  from the plain start (the stale "main menu not ported" line removed).
  Seen: main menu, pilot screen, c1m1's briefing (MECHLAB and SALVAGE grey
  on Op 1 Mission 1, as 0x408ef0 has it). render.md 6(c): c1m2's parked
  vehicle edge flicker, open.

## Front-end item 0: --briefing (2026-10-25)

- Branch mac4/fe-briefing off main 39e1251. `--briefing c1m2` (ours): a
  pilot "Briefing" saved with its newest campaign at the mission, then the
  driver clicks CAMPAIGN, the pilot, ACCEPT; the Campaign state goes on to
  the Load state. Two dead ends first: post_intro = Load (the briefing came
  up but the load stalled at "Loading Textures (0/17)" and the quit hung
  waiting for it: the Main state's set-up was skipped), and app.replace from
  the frame hook (queued but never run there).
- Seen: c1m2's briefing (map, route, MECHLAB and SALVAGE lit); MECHLAB opens
  the lab with an empty stockpile (a new campaign's store fill 0x470e30 /
  0x4733b0 not ported; plan item 1a added).

## Front-end item 1a: a new campaign's store (2026-10-25)

- Branch mac4/fe-store off main 724b11c. Finding: already ported
  (0x4345a0 with 0x4733b0, carried by 0x434e00); `--briefing` built its game
  at the mission (no stock, no field bases: the salvage capacity would be
  0). It now steps the pilot's new campaign with next_mission; the lab shows
  the Bushwhacker. 0x470e30 is the lab / IA / MP / training store (item 12).
- campaign_menus_to_c1m1 now checks c1m2's store: 0 mechs, 4 kind 1, 3
  ammo, 3 kind 3. Break (no new-campaign stock): a spare mech appears and
  the lab's ACCEPT checks fail. Traced (the lead asked why that reads
  backwards): with the stock the store is 1 Bushwhacker, 6463 units; each
  briefing takes the player's mech and loadout into the slot (0 mechs, 6106
  units) and 0x434e00 brings the lance back for the next mission (1, 6463)
  before c1m2's briefing takes it again. Without the stock the store is
  empty, the slot's take finds nothing (its mech -1, the player launches
  without the store's), and the Bushwhacker returned after c1m1 (1 mech,
  357 units) stays a spare. The kinds' counts matched because they count
  entries, not units (corrected).

## Front-end item 1: the salvage screen (2026-10-25)

- Branch mac4/fe-salvage2 off main 8a5c6d4 (the notes below came across
  from mac4/fe-salvage). Ported whole: `mech3/salvage_screen` (the screen,
  its lists, the two moves), the second Salvage State 0x608bd8 and
  `GameEngine::salvage_open`, construct 0x47d3b0.
- Seen live: `--briefing c1m2 --click-at 420,435@2500`: the stockpile, 6
  empty bays for 3 bases, the lance row; clicks moved 200 MG rounds, a heat
  sink, a CASE. The tonnage values overlap their captions (right-aligned
  font, the port's widths; for Owen).
- Tests: test_salvage_screen.py (new, 100/100; found the destruction order
  of BACKGROUND and SALVAGE_TEXT), test_salvage.py moves (200/200; floor,
  ftol and 0x4b4900 stood in), the campaign test's salvage stage. Breaks:
  screen 13/14, moves 4/5, headless 5/5 (the misses cannot show).

## Front-end item 1 (the salvage screen), mapped, set aside for 1a (2026-10-25)

Notes for when it resumes (branch mac4/fe-salvage):
- Open: 0x47d2f0 pushes the second Salvage State 0x608bd8 (app push
  0x590400). SalvageState (0x47d310/0x47d390) is ported; its construct
  0x47d3b0 (new 0x166a8) is the screen, vtable 0x5c3c88: +0x08 dtor
  0x47db10 (body 0x47db60), +0x14 press 0x47e490, +0x00 0x5a2bb0.
- Screen fields: +0x10fec state, +0x11368 ICON_ACCEPT (id 10), cards
  0x6a0 each (ctor 0x47db30 = LanceCard 0x47af70 with vtable 0x5c3d58,
  slot 0 0x47dcd0): 6 bays at +0x114c0, 4 lance at +0x13c80 (ids 4..7,
  ICON_PILOT, moved by (0x5e5b10 * i, 0x5e5b18), their children by the
  functor 0x47f1c0 / 0x47f140 / 0x47f1e0), PLAYER_SALVAGE +0x15700 (id 11,
  store +0x214 = 0x479430's), MISSION_SALVAGE +0x15dd0 (id 12, store the
  campaign's +0x3c, else [0x609990]), SALVAGE_TEXT +0x1655c (children at
  +0x110: [3] used tons, [4] capacity, [5] 0x163/0x164 with the bases),
  BACKGROUND +0x164a0. Lists' vtable 0x5c3ca8: +0x98 0x47da70 (a choice
  goes to the screen's +0x14 with the id +0x150 and the row).
- Constants: 0x5e5b08..18 = 120, 80, 60, -50, -70; 300 t and 2 mechs a
  field base (0x470cc0, 0x470cd0, mech_fieldbase_cut).
- 0x47e110 (player -> mission): n = 1; kind 2: 0x4b4900(+0x14, +0x04);
  kind 3 with +0x18 in {1, 2}: by count * 0.5 < 10, 20, 50, 200, 500:
  1, 2, 10, 20, 40, else 100; to.add_copy(item, n), on success
  from.remove(item, n); true.
- 0x47e270 (mission -> player): cap 300 * bases t, 2 * bases mechs; used
  = the player store's weight(-1) sum; kind 0: 1 if a bay is free (else
  the negative rest: refused); kind 2: 0x4b4900; kind 3 sub 1/2: min(count,
  ftol(2 floor(cap - used))); n > 0 and used + item.weight(n) <= cap:
  add, then remove; true.
- Refill 0x47dcf0: the lance cards from the game's slots (vt+0x34(i), vt+0x38
  the count: green 1 under it, else 3), the bays from the store's mechs
  (0x47b260, 0x484650 name) then empty ones up to 2 * bases, the lists
  refilled (vt+0x40, +0x3c, +0xa8), texts "%.1f %s" with the tons.

## Text widths (2026-10-25)

- Lead's item before lab 5b2: the tonnage overlap on the salvage screen.
  Branch mac4/fe-fonts off main 197a289.
- Found: the faces are the game's own TTFs and FreeType's MONO hinting
  gives GDI's advances (equal to Arial's and Impact's hdmx at every listed
  size); the gaps were the size for a positive (cell) height (scaled by
  FreeType's line height: Arial 12 at size 10, GDI 9 by VDMX, as Wine's
  tests record) and SDL_ttf's kerning. The salvage caption is "Current
  Tonnage:" (its colon was under the value).
- Ported GDI's rule (`frontend/sdl/gdi_font_size`, Wine's load_VDMX and
  calc_ppem_for_height), the ascent and descent from VDMX, kerning off.
  Shots before and after: the salvage panel, a briefing, the main menu,
  the HUD, the lab (scratchpad fonts/).


## Lab 5b2: the item rules (2026-10-25)

- Assignment (lead): plan item 2, 0x00453840 (may an item go on) and
  0x00454600 (put it on) with the Config helpers they ask; tested with
  test_lab_screen.py sessions with adds against the exe, breaks. Branch
  mac4/lab-5b2 off main d751ead.
- First half done: the item rule 0x00453840 (`can_xa8`), 0x00456750,
  Config's 0x00425ea0 / 0x00473570 (test_mechsave checks both, breaks
  2/2). test_lab_screen runs the exe's rule: 80/80, breaks 14 of 15 (the
  15th, armour's slot test with a part, is dead code). Harness: the float
  stub's `fld` thunk pops the argument itself (`ret 4`); the plan keeps to
  play's states (the rule reads the shown loadout unchecked).
- Second half next: the put-on 0x00454600 operates inline on the real
  loadout and store (armour by half tons and swaps, 0x004513f0 and
  0x004247a0, sinks and jump jets with messages, the firepoint pick with
  the static toggle 0x005e47d4); its own differential with exe objects.
- Second half done: the put-on 0x00454600 (`lab_put_on`, an Engine hook so
  the lab test keeps its stand-in), Config::remove 0x00471de0, find_like,
  spread_armor 0x004247a0. test_salvage.py's puton part runs the exe's
  put-on on real loadouts and stores: 200/200, breaks 12/14 (the two left
  are the remove's, unreachable from the put-on: test_mechsave covers the
  remove, 3/4, and the spread, 6/7; the misses cannot differ). Finds: the
  firepoint toggle (last, first, alternating, across mechs) and missiles
  with no scattering firepoint getting the part number as their firepoint.

## Lab 6: the criticals page (2026-10-26)

- Assignment (lead): plan item 3 (mechlab.md step 6), ASSIGNED_LIST
  (0x005c1fe0) and the part buttons; also answer whether the put-on's
  part-number firepoint can index past a mech's list. Branch mac4/lab-6 off
  mac4/lab-5b2 (5b2 under review).
- The firepoint question: no, not with shipped data (fixes.md candidate
  updated): only the Elemental has non-scattering firepoints, its arm
  parts 2 and 3 are within its 4, and the Elemental never reaches a lab.
- ASSIGNED_LIST mapped so far (vtable 0x5c1fe0, ctor 0x4552e0 = the base
  0x451b40(-1)): own slots +0x00 dtor 0x455300, +0x60 show 0x455340 (the
  base's), +0x64 hide 0x455350, +0x84 read 0x455320 (the base's), +0x90
  add_text 0x455bf0 (STATIC_FONT +0x1c4), +0x94 add_object 0x455b60
  (NORMAL_FONT when the loadout is the player's (+0x1c) and the lab not
  read-only, else STATIC), +0x98 add_part 0x455af0 (SELECTED_FONT when it
  is the selected row, else LARGE; +0x22c = the part being listed), +0x9c
  scroll 0x4559e0 (steps the chosen part through a fixed order via
  0x456130 -> 0x4560d0 its row -> +0xac), +0xa4 can_light 0x455f30 (a
  part row, or an item row on an editable lab), +0xa8 true, +0xac press
  0x455fb0 (an item: back to the store [0x605a80], off the loadout,
  recount, sound, refresh; a part: top = selected = row, refill, the part
  buttons 0x44d3e0, the 3D pick 0x4504d0), +0xb0 0x455f90 (not a part
  row), +0xb4 0x455f20, +0xb8 refill 0x4554d0.
- Refill 0x4554d0 (shown only): part = 0x455eb0 (-1: 6); clear
  (0x455d60); needs +0x220 and +0x224; +0x22c = -1; the slot's mech
  tech (0x484720); engine XL (+0x28) slots (3, 2 Clan) per side torso;
  recount; slots left; ferro (+0x34: 7 Clan / 14) and endo (+0x20: 7 Clan
  / 14) counters; then per part in order 6 head (msgs 0x24e, 0x24f x2,
  0x250), 1 CT (engine 0x432f00 name via 0x575fd0 0x251 with 6, gyro 0x252
  4), 7 LT / 8 RT (XL slots 0x253), 2 LA / 3 RA (0x255, 0x256), 4 LL / 5 RL
  (0x2d5, 0x257..0x259): add_part, add_text rows, then 0x4553f0 (the
  part's ferro / endo rows, "Endo Steel Internals", then its items via
  0x455360: an item whose vt+0x08 location(mech) is the part, its slots
  as the count, sinks of no group 0); then 0x456150(part) (selected row,
  the 3D pick 0x4504d0, the part buttons 0x44d3e0, UNASSIGNED refill),
  layout +0xb4, 0x455c50 (the part rows' slot bars 0x451870 and colour),
  each item row's mass "%.1f" (sprintf 0x5e406c) and count, their fonts
  COUNT when read-only else MASS.
- Done: ASSIGNED_LIST (`LabAssignedList`, every own slot and helper),
  LabPart's press 0x44f340, check_part 0x44d3e0, the row's slot bar
  0x451870, lab_take_off (an Engine hook), engine_name 0x432f00 shared.
  test_lab_screen runs the exe's list (loadouts with mirrored items, part
  buttons and arrows in the plan): 80/80; test_salvage's puton part takes
  items off with the exe's 0x455fb0: 200/200. Breaks 16/17. Finds: the
  arrows stop at the ends (my first table wrapped: the test caught it), and
  ferro-fibrous / endo steel rows appear in the parts only with no slots
  left.

## Lab 7: the weapon groups page (2026-10-26)

- Assignment (lead): plan item 4 (mechlab.md step 7), WEAPONS_UNGROUPED /
  WEAPONS_GROUPED. Branch mac4/lab-7 off main.
- Done: both weapon lists (`LabWeaponList`), the rows' location tags
  (`LabLocationTag`, vtable 0x5c16c0), LabScreen::refresh_groups 0x44dcf0
  (the shown slot read six times, as the exe; the test caught the one
  read I had), message_format_n for 0x24b. Harness: probe_lab sets the
  lab screen handle after the screen is made (the exe's [0x605a58] is 0
  during the constructor); a weapon groups session in the plan.
- Breaks 13/15 (the mouse-only can_choose; select_group's out-of-range
  case never differed in the runs, not traced further).

## Lab 8a (2026-10-26): ENGINE_TABLE and the engine presses

Assigned by the lead after lab 7 merged (8f5cd8c): split lab 8 into 8a (engine,
sinks, armour controls) and 8b (the data panels); fold in a plan case for
0x44e4e0's out-of-range branch.

- Found: there are no sink presses; presses 19..22 are the engine (19 up, 20
  down, 21/22 the XL toggle, both the same); 18 is a part button (ASSIGNED_LIST
  0x456130). The armour controls live in MECH_DATA (ARMORTYPE/ARMORMASS
  toggles) and ARMOR_TITLES, so they move to 8b. The data-table base
  (vtable 0x5c20a0, `LabTable`) is ported here, shared with 8b.
- Quirks: the weight row's format is " %s", so "tons" never shows; switching
  XL off needs the result strictly under the mech's tons (engine up allows
  equal).
- 0x44e4e0's out-of-range case is unreachable by presses (the grouped list
  only selects group rows; group_of maps rows outside the list to 0), so the
  plan sets a weapon row as chosen directly (op O).
- The fault was the XL weight's ceil (0x5bb61c, an unstubbed import); the
  test now serves it as FLOOR's twin. test_lab_screen 80/80; the refusals
  counted (0xdce x16, 0xdcf x18, 0xdd0 x3) and the XL type shown in 33 runs.
  The message box's text goes through 0x575ff0 (buffer, id), not vt+0x98.
- Plan widened after the first breaks: engine indices biased to the ends
  (0, 1, 77, 78), the weight stub at, just over, and (for XL loadouts) at
  the XL-to-standard limit and half an XL under it, XL loadouts half the
  time, 12..31 engine presses a session. Final: 80/80, refusals 0xdce x18,
  0xdcf x72, 0xdd0 x7; breaks 20/21 (the reading's flag clear is inert:
  nothing but hidden is set before a table reads).
- Docs: mechlab.md step 8a section, the dialog table's ids corrected (the
  SELECT_* are 23..26, the parts all 18, ENGINE_TABLE's 19..22), porting
  order split; discoveries (the engine panel); symbols.csv (27 rows).

## Lab 8b1 (2026-10-26): MECH_DATA, ENDOSTEEL and CHASSIS_DATA

Assigned by the lead after 8a merged (561cf2a): 8b, split if large. Split
(agreed): 8b1 MECH_DATA with its toggle and CHASSIS_DATA; 8b2 ARMOR_TITLES
and LOADOUT_LIST.

- Found: the dialog's ARMORTYPE / ARMORMASS toggles under MECH_DATA are
  dead data (neither string is in the exe); MECH_DATA's one control is
  ENDOSTEEL (a CycleButton at +0x188 whose step 0x457160 changes endo
  steel, with refusals 0xdd1 / 0xdd2). ARMOR_TITLES is the armour-by-section
  editor (11 section cycles 0x450880, a re-spread button 0x450c70).
- Ported: LabMechData, LabEndoCycle, LabChassisData, LabRow::set_float(v,
  unit) 0x457f90, engine_kph 0x433050; hooks lab_config_weight_of
  (0x425300 by kind) and lab_config_set_endo.
- Test: the panels are real on both sides now (the fakes and stubs gone);
  dump_data; op D (ENDOSTEEL stepped); 0x425300 answered by kind (8 the
  mech's most, 3 often at endo's limit). 80/80, 0xdd1 x59, 0xdd2 x6.
- Breaks 22 of 22 (the first run missed the slot need 14 to 12: the plan
  drew no 12 or 13 free slots; 6, 7, 12, 13 added). Related tests and both
  suites pass (202, 12).
- State: sent for review on mac4/lab-8b.

## Lab 8b2 (2026-10-26): LOADOUT_LIST and ARMOR_TITLES' display

Assigned after 8b1 merged (48cc1e8). ARMOR_TITLES turned out bigger than
mapped, so split again (agreed): 8b2 LOADOUT_LIST and ARMOR_TITLES' making,
reading, show/hide and refresh; 8b3 its three presses (REMOVE 0x450cc0,
DISTRIBUTE 0x450c70, the section step 0x4509b0). Lead for 8b3: the plan must
step a section at both ends (front 0, rear at its cap) and press REMOVE
with nothing left to take off.

- Found: ARMOR_TITLES is a Control with ARMOR_REMOVE (+0x14c), eleven
  ARMOR_TOGGLE cycles (+0x2a4, toggle k = section k, all reading the same
  entry) and ARMOR_DISTRIBUTE (+0x3088); the toggles' places are function
  statics ([0x605aac..0x605ab8], guard [0x605ab4]), kept in LabState.
  LOADOUT_LIST lists by probe items (find_like/count_like), "(0 rounds)"
  for an ammo weapon with no ammo (discoveries).
- Ported: LabLoadoutList (0x44b230, can_light/choose false), LabArmorTitles,
  LabArmorRemove (set_tons), LabArmorToggle (place, refresh, step's start),
  LabArmorDistribute; the presses call the original for now. Hooks
  lab_config_sinks/double_sinks/section, message_format_isi; GameEngine's
  message_format_is was missing (the debriefing's 0xdc0 came out empty),
  added with format_message_f. zutl::format_message_v now keeps a width
  ("%1!2d!", 0x1c5): it read that number as a string.
- FIX (bug): the panel's texts read unchecked (fixes.md); the summary loops
  weapon_count() (the exe's 0x25; the plain PPC with zfix bugs).
- Test: the fake ARMOR_TITLES and the 0x44b230 / 0x450e00 stubs gone; the
  loadouts get sinks and section points (some bare); weapons with and
  without ammo; an armour session; synthetic dialogs keep ARMOR_TITLES /
  ARMOR_REMOVE (moved, texts cut past 6). lab_screen 80/80 identical (43 seeds with rounds lines, 42 with plain weapon or equipment lines; the armour panel shown and hidden, moved, DISTRIBUTE on and off). Breaks 31 of 31 caught (12 on the loadout list, 19 on the armour panel; armour kinds in a loadout were added to catch the last).
- State: done on mac4/lab-8b2, sent to the lead.


## Lab 8b3 (2026-10-26): ARMOR_TITLES' presses

Assigned after 8b2 merged (fd3f05f). The lead asked for a section stepped at both ends
(front at 0, rear at its cap) and a REMOVE press with nothing to take off.

- Ported: the section step 0x4509b0 (down a point, none below 0; up under the most with
  points left, else one from the torso's other side; at the most with that side empty a
  return, no redraw), REMOVE 0x450cc0 (the click, then the mech's armour probe, half a ton
  to the store and off the loadout, the spread when over) and DISTRIBUTE 0x450c70.
  New hooks: lab_config_set_section, lab_config_spread_armor (Config::spread_armor),
  lab_config_remove, lab_store_add_equipment; GameEngine's on Config and Store.
- No changes from the original (no FIX).
- Test: stubs for the spread (0x4247a0), the store's add (0x471a20) and the loadout's
  remove (0x471de0, through a vtable the loadouts now have), none changing anything; half
  the loadouts (70%) carry their armour as an item; the armour session runs first and
  sets sections (A, the most from the front toggle's text), steps toggles (I) and presses
  REMOVE/DISTRIBUTE (F), the lead's ends first, and sets a section so none are left (A 3). lab_screen 80/80 identical. Breaks 28 of 28 caught (13 on REMOVE, 3 on DISTRIBUTE, 12 on the step; a section set so none are left (A mode 3) was added to catch the last two).
- State: done on mac4/lab-8b3, sent to the lead. Related set: lab_list, salvage, mechsave, salvage_screen, field_cut, mw3tests 202, mw3sdltests 12 pass.

## Lab 9 (2026-10-26): the lab's loadout reaching the launch

- Branch mac4/lab-9 off main 6832ebc.
- Found: the engine's launch record took the slot's mech, loadout and skin at
  the Load state's start (load_state_enter), and the slot block the launch
  asks for (game vcall 0x34) was built from it. Choosing a loadout in the lab
  (LOADOUT_LIST, 0x00433df0) frees the slot's config and makes a copy; when
  the copy lands elsewhere the launch read the freed one (a crash in
  Config::weight). The exe reads the slot at the launch (0x491150).
- Changed: `GameEngine::launch_slot_refresh` reads the pilot's game's slot
  again when the block is asked for (from the menus). LaunchedMech gains the
  config (+0x3ec). `--verbose` from the menus prints the player's mech 30
  frames into the mission. No FIX (the port's wiring).
- Test: the campaign test's lab stage picks the loadout from LOADOUT_LIST,
  takes a weapon off (criticals, its row), engine a step slower (20), centre
  torso a point off (toggle 0), ACCEPT, LAUNCH; the launched mech has the
  live slot's config with 5 weapons (6), engine 52 (53), 22.09 m/s (c1m1's
  22.50), centre torso 22 (23), both passes. Break (the refresh off): the
  fix=false pass crashes in the launch on the freed config; the fix=true pass's
  copy lands at the old address, so its stale handle still names the new one.

  22.50, 23". Shots of the five pages in the outbox (2026-10-26/lab9).
- 8b3's 26 older breaks against the final plan: all 26 still caught.

## Save 1 (2026-10-26): zSave and the campaign's read-back

- Branch mac4/save-load off main aa405ed. frontend-plan item 7 split in
  three with the lead: save 1 (this), save 2 the anim registrants, save 3
  live and "Replace existing game?".
- Found: a saved campaign's `pilots\games` file is zSave's (0x5a8a20..
  0x5a9970, not zEntity's as the hooks were named); without it the pilot
  read back drops every saved campaign. MW3's InitInstance switches on only
  the three anim registrants (GWWorld, craters, weapons off). Saved at a win
  with that mission loaded, into the next game's file; read back by the
  mission load through the game's vt+0x28 (0x4352d0) for a game read from
  the pilot file; every other game's vt+0x28 answers true ("Saved Game
  Loaded" in IA and training).
- Ported: `gamez/zsave` whole (registry, sort, save, header, load, temps),
  CampaignGame::restore, Game::restore, the pilot hooks' save_world /
  load_world defaults, save_init / save_shutdown (renamed from
  entity_init / entity_shutdown), game_saved. FIX (bug) x3 for damaged
  files (zar's table count, a name without a sub, an entry longer than the
  file); zar's seek keeps SetFilePointer's signed distance (FIX (A) made
  faithful).
- Tests: test_zsave.py 200/200 (fake registrants from x86, damaged files,
  the fixes applied to the original by hooks, --nofix shows the exe's
  crashes); breaks 18/18. The campaign test's round trip (a new app reading
  the pilots back, the test registrant's entry restored, slot, loadout,
  lance and holdings as they were) in both zfix passes; breaks 4/4.

## Save 2 (2026-10-26): the anim registrants

- Branch mac4/save-2 off main fff16b0.
- Found: the restore is by def and node index, which is sound: an
  operation's missions share one world and the two missions the restore
  skips (Op 1 M1, Op 4 M4) are the world changes. A reloaded campaign brings
  the last mission's animation state into the next (discoveries). At the win
  CoreState::leave has run 0x50ace0(1) (wrong, corrected in save 3: the
  Win State's save comes before the Core state leaves).
- Ported in zeff_anim_save: the three savers and loads, 0x50be30, the log's
  accessors and replay (0x50b640/6f0/700, 0x50ca60, 0x50ca90), the switch
  0x5090d0 (GameEngine::anim_enable) and the registration in anim_init
  (anim_register_savers; the hook register_entities is gone). Quirks kept:
  the save binds defs to their nodes; an instance's running record goes onto
  the def; a missing instance is made idle; the model flag only set back.
  FIX (bug) for damaged entries (short, index outside the defs, too many
  sequences).
- Tests: test_anim_save.py, all six worlds identical (mid and win saves,
  entries compared as words, loads, the exe's entries cross-loaded by the
  port, 20 frames after; damaged entries loaded by the port). test_anim_run
  refactored into prepare/play (behaviour unchanged).
- Breaks 19/27 caught on c1 (the 8 not seen are explained in save.md: data
  no world has, a flag the replays restore anyway, states random play never
  reaches at a save on any world). The three damaged-entry fixes left out
  crash the port. Related set: test_anim_run, anim_binder, zsave, anim,
  anim_owner, puffers, pilot, mw3tests 202 and mw3sdltests 12, all pass.

## Save 3 (2026-10-26): the live round trip and "Replace existing game?"

- Branch mac4/save-3 off main 6712fbd.
- First, save 2's follow-up (lead): test_anim_save forces the four states
  random play never reached at a save (a def in error, a running copy at
  another node, a resting copy, a nodeless reset record loaded onto an
  invalid def). The running copy needed its def's last log record moved to
  the def's own node: the activations' save otherwise binds the def onto the
  copy's node, and the def and copy are saved at the same node. Breaks now
  23/27 (the 4 left: data no world has, or a flag the replays restore).
- The damaged loads, now on all six worlds, crashed the port on c4: a
  running entry's sound parent index past the node pool. FIX (bug)
  saved_node for every node index a load reads (fixes.md row extended).
- Found live: the Win State's save runs with the mission as it is (the Core
  state is only suspended under the end screen, fade and Win State), so the
  win's save holds the runs going on (c1m1: 80 RunningAnim entries); save 2's
  "stopped first" was wrong. test_anim_save's saves relabelled (the win's,
  then one after 0x50ace0), save.md, discoveries corrected.
- `--win N` (ours, program.md): Exit Mission once won, through the end
  screen, fade, debriefing and Win State; `--verbose` prints the pilot's
  game at the win and at each loaded briefing.
- tools/analysis/savecheck.py: straight on and reloaded c1m2 briefings hold
  the same (store and salvage, mech and loadout, lancemates), "Saved Game
  Loaded" only on the reload, Replace No keeps the file, OK rewrites it.
  8/8 checks; breaks 5/5. Clicks (game pixels): CAMPAIGN 70,60, the pilot
  150,135, ACCEPT 470,320, the first saved game 467,46, LAUNCH 556,435, the
  debriefing's checkmark 595,445, the Replace box's OK 246,290 and NO
  392,290. Shots: outbox/2026-10-27/save3.
- Open: the Replace box is drawn over a flat light grey screen (the end
  screen's fade); whether the original looks the same is not checked.

## Message box backdrop (2026-10-27)

- Branch mac4/msgbox off main b9931e9.
- The Replace box's flat grey was the end fade's: the tint quad's vertices
  never got the exe's setup (0x579c60: specular 0xff000000; 0x57dd40 from
  the device setup: z/rhw 0.99), so the quad came out fully fogged (c1's
  fog 214,211,214). The exe's call sites all fade to black.
- The grey (then black) squares under the box's buttons: the dialog grabs
  the screen after drawing its static parts and the buttons redraw from
  that grab; after a 3D frame screen_grab returned the frame shown (pause
  FIX (A)), which lacks the dialog. FIX (A): the first 2D lock after a
  Render3D frame reads it into the buffer (the exe's back buffer kept the
  last frame).
- The quit box on the main menu stood on the key magenta: 0x004ac150's
  empty lock/unlock of the back buffer key-filled the menu's picture. FIX
  (A): an empty 3D lock over a 2D picture gives it back (copied in place:
  the 2D targets point at the buffer).
- tools/analysis/boxcheck.py 3/3, breaks 3/3. The pause test now accepts the
  frame already in the buffer. Related: twod_msgbox, fade, app_states,
  fadecheck, savecheck, mw3tests 202, mw3sdltests 12.

## Item 8 (2026-10-27): an operation's end and the campaign's

- Branch mac4/op-end off main 6ff2b6b. Not split: the operation's end is the
  ordinary passed-mission path; the new pieces are the Win Movie State
  (0x47a960/9b0/a50/ac0, `WinMovieState`, GameEngine::replace_state_at for
  0x608be8) and the Load state's briefing movie (0x40a820 the app's +0x1c1,
  0x409320 fmv.zrd c<op>m<n>: the opener), movies still not played (zFMV).
- The campaign's last mission is Op 4 Mission 6 (c4bm6), not m7.
- Headless `campaign_operation_end_and_campaign_end_headless`: c1m4 won ->
  c2m1's briefing, the field bases lowered to 1 in the mission and back to
  3, the movies asked for c1m4 then c2m1; Op 4 Mission 6 won -> c4win asked
  for, Main, Credits. A movie-recording GameEngine subclass; the stepped
  campaign's salvage marked seen (else LAUNCH's box answers no headless).
- Live (`tools/analysis/opcheck.py`, --verbose now prints each state by
  name): c1m4 -> Win State -> Load State, c2m1's briefing (a lancemate,
  field bases 3); c4bm6 -> Win State -> Credits State (Win Movie and Main
  replace within a frame). 5/5.
- Breaks 5/5 headless, 3/5 live (the field bases and the movie names are not
  visible live). Discovery: the ending movie ignores -nofmv.

## Item 9a (2026-10-27): the lab's 3D view

- Branch mac4/lab3d off main 8a23e87. Split with the lead: 9a the world,
  camera and turning model; 9b the armour section's highlight (0x4504d0 /
  0x450470: there is no mouse picking; 0x4507c0 is the chassis lookup).
- Ported: zcls world_create 0x4f1bd0, the area 0x4f2500 / 0x4f2530, the
  grid 0x4f2560; mech3 lab_view.cpp: the load 0x44ffc0, unload 0x450390,
  the window 0x450460/0x44fea0, the entries 0x44fcc0/ce0/d20, the camo
  0x44fd90, the frame 0x450690 (lab_view_frame), the target 0x450810 and
  clear 0x450800; GameEngine::node_frame_update (0x4f7f70, was a hook: the
  copied tree never got its matrices). The turn is time-based (dt * 0.8).
- test_lab_view.py 300/300 bit for bit, breaks 14/14 (Compare(tol=0): the
  default tolerance let small integers pass as tiny floats; raised with the
  lead for the other tests using it). --lab-mech N (ours) for the shots: all
  19 chassis and a camo swap, outbox 2026-10-27/lab3d.

## Item 9b (2026-10-27): the armour section's highlight

- Branch mac4/lab-highlight off main cf36ef9. Ported 0x4504d0 / 0x450470
  (lab_highlight, lab_highlight_part; the hook renamed lab_section_highlight).
  test_lab_view.py adds the highlight: 300/300, breaks 9/9 (two sections in
  a row so the off pass shows).
- Live, the parts did not turn green: the tint reaches the GPU only through
  the vertices' fog, and the port's FOGENABLE came on only in the shadow
  passes (a mission frame). The exe's device setup turns fog on for good
  (0x57bb70(1)): ported as zvid::set_fog, called in video_open. Then the
  torso, arms and legs show green (outbox 2026-10-27/lab3d).
## Compare (2026-10-27): integers exactly

- test_anim_run's Compare (used by test_anim_run, test_anim_save) gave every
  differing word the float tolerance, so small integers and flag words
  (denormals as floats) passed: 1 against 0 within 1e-4. Now only words
  that are zero or normal floats on both sides get it. test_puffers' own
  compare already types its words; test_anim_binder does not use it.
- Reruns: test_anim_run (6 worlds, 60 frames) and test_anim_save (6 worlds,
  60 + 20) identical, the same counts within tolerance: nothing had been
  hidden. test_anim_save's four uncaught breaks again: the active flag not
  restored is now caught (it was the tolerance, not the replays as save.md
  said); the three others stay unseen (data no world has). 24/27.
- The breaks script's "stopped" match also took "running_stopped" in a
  passing summary line: read rc with it.


## Item 10 (2026-10-27): zFMV's script without video

- Branch mac4/fmv-script off main cfad444. Ported fmv_script.cpp
  (0x00598cc0..0x0059a490: the script, its load, play and poll, the image,
  wait, fade, blur and sound actions; PLAYAVI a stub that ends at once, as
  the exe's without the file; PLAYMCI unused, not ported) to
  src/gamez/zfmv, and the blur passes 0x0055a540 / 0x00559ec0 / 0x0055a1b0
  / 0x0055a3b0 to zrender/zrndr_blur. GameEngine's movie hooks and the
  pause screen's blur (wait_new / start / poll / end) run them
  (mech3/app_fmv.cpp, a zfmv::Host on the Engine's hooks). docs/fmv.md.
- test_fmv.py: 428 scripts (every shipped block named, random ones with
  every verb and bad entries), 115k calls identical with each poll's answer,
  the current action and every loaded action's fields; the pause blur; the
  passes bit for bit (the target padded: a narrow rect's walk reads the rows
  around it). Breaks 31/31 (the two first missed, a PLAYAVI flag default and
  SHOWIMAGE with one coordinate, are caught by the fields check and
  three-item entries).
- Two 24-bit details: the poll's t - start is a float (the fade's alpha was
  one bit off without it); a 0-second fade's NaN alpha is the x87's negative
  NaN, ARM's positive (the test ignores the NaN's sign).
- Live: the first image fetch at the intro marked zImage's library missing
  for good: the shell's start-up 0x00516f50("zbd") was never wired in
  GameEngine (the main menu mounted "zbd" itself later). Now
  GameEngine::geometry_init gives it to the 2D host's mounts.
- The SPLASH logos are stretched into the 2D surface and shown only by the
  WAIT's end flip (frame 3 with --shot-any), i.e. while the main menu
  loads; the 4 seconds before show the previous screen. In the port that
  is black for 5 s at start (INTRO's WAIT 1 and SPLASH's 4, the movie
  skipped). To check on the original.
- mw3tests: the programs through the Intro now meet SPLASH's 4 s; the tests'
  FakeClock (16 ms a call) took them past their pump limits. Platform gets a
  `movie_clock` (zFMV's timeGetTime; none: the frame clock) and the tests a
  second-a-call one. Five c1m4 AI tests with counts recorded from a start
  without the wait set `lobby_flow_` (which only skips the Intro's movies).
  The start test now expects 0x00598cc0 ported. geometry_init forwards only
  the start-up's "zbd": the missions' "zbd;zbd\<op>" as mounts would stay
  for the next mission's files (kept as before: logged).

## Pause check and item 11 (2026-10-27): the movies' video

- Pause: --tap Escape in c1 did not pause because with --shot-any every
  presented frame counts, and c1's loading and start fade present about 600
  before the Core state's first frame; the taps landed before the mission
  polled input, and the Core state's start unacquires the keyboard
  (DirectInput's buffer goes with it). --tap 1@900:902 --shot-frame 960
  pauses over the blurred battlefield (outbox 2026-10-27/fmv). No change.
- Branch mac4/fmv-video off main 469bec8. The AVIs: 640x480 Indeo 5 at 15
  fps, PCM 22,050 Hz (8-bit mono; INTRO and C1 16-bit stereo); INTRO all key
  frames, the rest one every 15. pl_mpeg reads 22 kHz Layer II, but MPEG-1
  has no 15 fps: the importer writes 30 fps with every frame twice and the
  player decodes by count. The lead: keep the sound as the AVI's PCM.
- mw3import (tools/import, optional, FFmpeg's libraries): .m1v (an MPEG-1
  video stream: the program stream's muxer warned of buffer underflow at q
  2), .wav (the AVI's PCM bytes), .fmv (the stream headers and idx1's key
  frames, text). Indeo packets that decode to no picture repeat the last.
- fmv_stream.cpp ported (0x0059a4a0..0x0059b040): the opens, the frame with
  the key-frame catch-up, the sound's frame from the play cursor, the
  refills (the second piece's count quirk kept). PLAYAVI's step and start
  (0x00599de0 / 0x00599ea0) on it. Video for Windows goes to the Host:
  app_movie.cpp answers from the importer's files, pl_mpeg vendored
  (third_party/pl_mpeg, compiled as C).
- --nosound's silent output kept the play cursor at 0, so the sound's frame
  was the end at once: it moves with a clock now (FIX (A), fixes.md).
- test_fmv.py: 200 movie runs among 628 scripts, 167k calls identical (every
  decompress flag, both key searches, locks split, the cursor at the halves);
  breaks 22/22 (two first missed: a format past 0x6c, the cursor exactly at
  the half). mw3 --movie NAME (ours): on a clock stepping 1/60 s a poll each
  frame is drawn once; every block drew its AVIs' dwLength frames, the last
  dwLength - 1.

## Item 12a (2026-10-27): the Action screen

- Branch mac4/instant-action off main 290b3af. Item 12 split: 12a the
  Action screen and its state (0x00488bc0..0x0048aac0, the ACCEPT's
  ActionGame fill); 12b the launch from it (the 0x00470e30 store, the 0x231
  header, the IA Dummy State, headless wave 1 to the tallies).
- Mapped from the asm (the decompile loses ECX in 0x0048aac0, 0x0048a810,
  0x0048a930): the five scenarios (0x005e6fb0: ia mission, mode, name,
  description), the worlds 0xe33..0xe36, the line-up's copies placed OFFSET
  apart, the enemies' loadouts from the definitions (training ones never),
  the progression waves (0x004897b0, at most 20).
- Ported as action_menu.{h,cpp}; the program's construct(0x00488bc0) makes
  it, action_open resets it. Live: --click-at 60,180@40 (INSTANT ACTION),
  a pilot typed, ACCEPT: the screen as the original (outbox 2026-10-27/ia).
- The decompile's 0x0048a140 read the world's row as the scenario's: the
  emulator's crash (an out-of-range world, read unchecked) showed +0x38 is
  the world's name. A wave outside the table (the best 20 at the reset, or
  below 0) reads strings as mechs: FIX (bug), hooked in the test.
- test_actionscreen.py: 60/60 (876k calls, the pilot file's bytes too);
  breaks 34/35 (the miss unobservable). The first batch missed four: the
  dump lacked the items' values, and the best wave 20 was rare (weighted).

## Item 12b (2026-10-27): the launch from the Action screen

- Branch mac4/ia-launch off main f8143ad. The store fill 0x00470e30 ported
  (Store::fill_all, equip_has_tech 0x00484a00); test_store_fill.py 4/4,
  124 items (125 with the plain PPC fix).
- The program's Load state refused Instant Action (back to the main menu):
  it now takes the world (vt+0x54, +0x74) as the directory and the ia
  mission (vt+0x4c, +0x78).
- The 0x231 header: %1!d! is vt+0x48 (world + 1), %2 vt+0x0c (+0x3c, the
  scenario's name): hud.md 24's open note closed.
- The IA Dummy State (0x0047ce80) and the wreck's tally wired to the
  launch's ActionGame; CONTINUE's round (Engine::action_next_round, the
  debriefing probe's model). test_actionscreen.py enters the state: 60/60.
- Headless instant_action_menus_to_wave1_tallies_headless: menus, the
  Action screen on Progression, the briefing, wave 1 killed, wave 2, the
  header, Exit Mission, ABORT, the tallies (2/0/0, best 1), the pilot file,
  the Action screen again with Wave 2. The test first acted inside the
  Action State's resume (its flip presents a frame while the pilot's pop
  is still running): it now waits for an empty queue.

## Item 13a (2026-10-27): training's fourteen condition types

- Branch mac4/training off main 2b41549. Item 13 split: 13a the fourteen
  types' reading (0x0045c920's other branches) and checks; 13b the lesson
  list (the training game's vt+0x40 0x00437140, 0x0045ed40..0x0045f080,
  0x004373b0), the TR Dummy State (0x006098c8, enter 0x00491ab0: the
  mission passed, the pilot saved, Main with the training menu again), the
  program's answers for the checks, headless t1 lesson 1 (m11: a 1 s
  time_limit; m12 User_Command CMD_SHUTDOWN; m13 face_object).
- Read from the asm (the decompile is mostly inlined strcmps): each
  branch's keys, its object's size and vtable, its required values.
  aim_at_object asks 0x00444330 on the screen's +0x144c.
- test_objectives.py: the t1 blocks are compared whole now (were "must be
  reported unported"), made-up training conditions, coverage of every
  branch. test_objective_check.py: a training world from a shared mix
  (speed, aim hit and node parents, target slot and entity, aimed part,
  facing, heat, weapon manager and group, current weapon, weapon fired,
  clock, view angles, buttons); the Python fake's 0x005a85e0 returned one
  buffer for every object (entity - player was 0): each object its own.
  FIX (bug)s hooked into the original: view_object and weapon_group_select
  with no vehicle / weapon manager.

## Item 13b (2026-10-27): training's lessons and the TR Dummy State

- Branch mac4/training-lessons off mac4/training (main 90765a1 merged in).
- The lessons: TrainingLessons (0x0045ed40..0x0045f080) and training_load
  (vt+0x40, 0x00437140) in mech_objective, the training game's `lessons`.
  test_training_lessons.py found the shared description slot: the `_set`
  lessons and the failed reads leave their desc in the mission's slot.
- The TR Dummy State (0x00491ab0) in app_states; the end screen's fade to
  it; test_actionscreen.py enters it (training selected first: 0x004794a0
  answers only for the current game, the exe writes through null else).
- The program answers the training checks (zInput, the controls, the
  clock, the camera; the mech and HUD fields through app_mech.cpp helpers:
  mech.h / hud.h / weapon.h clash with app_mission.cpp's Handle).
- Headless training_menus_to_lesson3_headless: 14 lessons, m11 done at
  frame 63, CMD_SHUTDOWN's key, m13 at 65, mission 1 passed, the pilot
  file, the pilot screen again.

## Item 14 (2026-10-27): the mission plan

- docs/mission-plan.md: the census (c1m1 with input, 30 s: 84 unported,
  163 on 10-21; every campaign mission and t1 idle: all in c1m1's set but
  c4b's three mech hooks), each system's state, an 11-item order.
- `--mission c4m4` loads world c4 (no such mission: no mech); c4b's are
  c4bm4..c4bm6. The 180 s census hangs (30 s is fine); one c1m1 quit
  trapped (133) once in four; c4m2 is 8x slower headless.

## Mission-plan item 1 (2026-10-27): the hooks still reached

- Branch mac4/wire-hooks. Wired in the program's hooks (the defaults stay:
  test_mech_build records 0x004d9840 / 0x00491d20 through them): the cheat
  check, the brain's settings, the view's constructor log, find_node /
  node_set_active / camera_set_lod_scale, the HUD screen (0x00430aa0) and
  its weapons layout, the game-type answers, ai_targets_shutdown.
- c4b's 0x0041aba0 / 0x0041ca30 / 0x0041cc30 came from `c4m4` (no mech).
- `MW3_TRACE_UNPORTED` found 0x00430aa0's caller (MechCamera::set_look).
- Census 84 -> 73; c4bm4 79; mw3tests 205/0.

## Mission-plan item 2 (2026-10-27): the quit trap and the census hang

- Branch mac4/quit (main 9188039). The crash reports (EXC_BREAKPOINT in
  xzone malloc, in Metal's and CoreAudio's teardown) were heap damage;
  build-asan/mw3 named it: mw3_main's stop_game after run's ExitInstance
  (zsnd::unlock on freed voices). Dropped: the exe leaves the world to
  the process's end on WM_QUIT.
- The 180 s census: not a hang. sample showed HudRadar walking
  radar_blips; 0x004b4ab0 (the list's clearing object) was unwired, and
  so were WeaponCalls' object3d_create / set_action_priority / set_action
  / node_destroy. 30 s: 2,500 entries before, at most 4 after.
- Checks: the c1m1 Owens test (0x004b4ab0 not reached unported) and the
  census (at most 100 shots listed); both fail unwired. 180 s census 91 s.
- Note: mw3tests filters by MW3_TEST, not its argument.

## Mission-plan item 4 (2026-10-27): the vehicles' shadows

- Branch mac4/vehicle-shadows (main 1787227). The exe's vtables: vt+0x2c
  itself and vt+0x50 0x40bae0 (0) for vehicles, field bases, turrets and
  the pocket marker (0x5ccfe0), so all of them cast 32x32 at their own
  height. `shadow_entity` resolves each zEntity entry through the
  program's registries; `update_mech_shadows` keeps the exe's sums.
- Test: the c1m1 shadows test moves the first vehicle 40 m from the player
  (skipping the frame of the move: the upkeep runs in the draw before it)
  and checks near/far casters, 32x32, drawn. Breaks: vehicles dropped from
  the lookup (both checks fail).
- `--vehicle-ahead M` (ours) for the shot; `move_mech` at frame 1 moves the
  reported position but not what the camera follows (not chased).
- Shots: outbox/2026-10-27/item4_c1m3_*.png (on, off, the crop).
- The pocket marker is a plain AiTarget (no destructor): its caster would
  outlive the mission. The mission's end (0x0049dc40) now frees it
  (`program_pocket_marker_end`, the base end 0x004d58a0's part; matched by
  the object: the panel's globals are reset first); the entry was the
  unported "entity vt+0x0" before. The c1m4 pocket test moves the marker by
  the player at the quit, checks it casts and that no caster is left.

## Mission-plan item 5 (2026-10-27): the model priority and the skis' quads

- Branch mac4/model-priority (main 63cb569). 0x0053bb20 in gmod_const
  (`zmod::model_set_priority`), 0x004776d0 / 0x00477730 in mech_skis
  (`ski_polygon`, `ski_material`); the program's WiredBuild and the script
  engine's Object3DSetPriority wired; the hooks' defaults stay (test_mech_build
  stubs both as calls out).
- The ski model's priority is set before its quads exist (a no-op); the
  quads and the feet's _shadow models are inactive, so nothing shows. What
  changes in play: the build's rand()s (at least 12 a mech), as the exe's.
- test_ski_polygon.py: 1,325 runs, the exe's rand() stubbed with MSVC's
  LCG on the same seed; the material's flag bits 3..7 are stack garbage
  in the exe (compared: bits 0..2). Breaks: the seed, the points, the
  priority, r/g swapped, the threshold, the green mask.
- The rand()s moved three c1m4 runs' exact values (port-only pins, not the
  exe's): re-pinned. In "fires on a target" he turns from ghsD2 to ghsD3
  and lands two hits in 40 s (30 -> 16 -> 9) where the hut was down
  before; he holds the trigger most of the run.
- Open: so few hits landing from 80 m (two in ~1,000 firing frames) may be
  worth a look on its own (aim, line of sight, the lasers' recharge).
- Open: `move_mech` on the first Core frame (item 4's shot) moves the
  reported position but not what the camera follows.

## Mission-plan item 6 (2026-10-27): the start-up's leftovers

- Branch mac4/startup-leftovers (main bb6d4b8). Also mission-plan.md's new
  item 8, AI hit rate at range (lead).
- MW3_TRACE_UNPORTED on each key (the frames need c++filt) named the
  callers. 0x00413e60: alone, the limp structure 0x005e1f78 is 0.4, the
  port read the data's 0.3; the damage scale is the scripts' DamageScale
  (interp_globals), which mech_parts / mech_damage now read. HitGlobals in
  mech_parts, hit_globals_init from the program's mechs_init,
  hit_globals_reset in the tests' reset_process_state.
- test_hit_globals.py: 0x413e60 with its other calls stubbed, both flags,
  and the values before; breaks: the flag, the values before.
- 0x00490720: GameEngine::missions_reset called the logging base first.
- No effect: 0x004b52e0, 0x0047f2b0, 0x004ac860 (stealth), 0x004ab6b0
  (resolution step 3). symbols.csv has all six.

## Mission-plan item 7 (2026-10-27): the script engine's live calls

- Branch mac4/script-calls (main 5b457fa). The dispatcher's `call` became a
  macro over `call_named`, counting null entries by field
  (`zint::null_calls`); `--verbose` prints them. 21 missions, 600 frames
  each: the same 14, all from the support scripts (interp_dump.py's
  scripts.txt shows the values).
- Ported: 0x53cef0 / 0x53cf00, 0x538070, 0x538080 (gmod_const's planar and
  colinear became globals), 0x526df0, 0x526a00, 0x579240. Wired as nothing:
  0x536a60 (empty), 0x5269a0 (gamez.zbd sets the pool), the three
  software perspective setters, the three loose-file paths.
- Tests: test_script_setters.py (400; the getter's st(0) stored by a stub
  fstp; breaks: the backface, the getter), test_gmod_add.py at set
  tolerances (break 3: the colinear), the c1m1 Owens test (none skipped,
  the four settings; break: vertex shading unwired).

## Mission-plan item 8 (2026-10-27): the AI's hit rate (diagnosis only)

- Branch mac4/ai-hit-rate (main 5d1f7a2). Temporary traces (removed): the
  firing's phase and aim, the manager's trigger and the beam's charge, the
  beam's ray hits and their parents, zWeapon's apply_damage handler and the
  target's on_hit. Findings in ai.md 17.7a: the exe's design at each step.
- Open: the Gauss rifle (group 1) never fires in that run.

## Mission-plan item 8b (2026-10-27): the Gauss rifle in fires_on_a_target

- Branch mac4/gauss-pick (main 8558212). Traces (removed): the volley
  pick's inputs and choice, phases 2-4 with the current weapon, the torso's
  facing, the slug's flight, the target's lock point. The Gauss is picked
  and fires once at 15.22 s, 80 degrees off (in_reach at facing > 0: the
  firing's thresholds are the exe's 0s, read from 0x5e8868; nothing writes
  them). The original's design; ai.md 17.7a corrected (the 10 m was the
  beams' contact, the target 80.7 -> 31.5 m).
## Mission-plan item 9 (2026-10-27): the HUD's free

- Branch mac4/hud-free (main 8558212; 8b is docs). WiredData::hud_free
  deletes the Hud; ~Hud, ~HudReticle (0x00444280), ~HudLight's release
  loop (inlined in 0x00442d00 / 0x0043d810), ~HudTarget (0x00440190),
  ~HudMfd (0x004422b0) with the new hook nav_list_free (the program's
  LanceDisplay map). Hud::live counts HUDs (ours, tests).
- test_hud.py: a free after the dump on half the seeds. Its fake nav
  objects got a vtable (vt+0 recorded) and the MFD views' swapped vtable
  keeps the real slots (vt+0 the deleting destructor). The first
  differences found each missing release, in order: TARGET's arrows,
  the lights' images, the reticle's four.
- Breaks: hud_free empty (the mission-end test), the reticle's releases
  dropped (test_hud seed 0, call 4869).

## Mission-plan item 10 (2026-10-27): the app's sound set

- Branch mac4/app-sounds (main faefeba). The "sound set" is the app's
  +0x1e4 passed to two empty functions (0x0040baf0 ret 8, 0x004a5bc0 ret
  4) by the briefing's load (0x004096b0..); GameEngine answers them and
  0x0040a7d0 / 0x0040a830. Check in the c1m1 Owens test (break: app_sounds
  back to the hook).

## Mission-plan item 11 (2026-10-27): the census's known keys

- Branch mac4/plumbing (main 390007c). GameEngine::known_unported: 22 keys
  with their reason (own 4, deferred 11, no effect 7); not logged, listed
  apart by --verbose and the census; unported_counts unchanged (tests read
  the stealth key's count). Census: 39 unported, 22 known.
- The plan's "~45 plumbing" was too many: checked one by one, the rest are
  ported-but-unwired calls, settings the exe changes from the data (the
  HSE test, the animation records, the frame clear), the span target's
  rect (the fade's tint), and ones still to trace: mission-plan items
  12-15.

## Mission-plan item 13 (2026-10-27): the start-up's settings

- Branch mac4/start-settings (main 2a750f2). GameEngine: effects_set_a /
  _b, video_set_clear, camera_set_hse_test (the hooks renamed from
  camera_set_near / _far: 0x004f3540 writes [0x005ea53c], unread; 0x004f3550
  is CameraSetObjectHSETest). reset_process_state restores the data's.
- Measured with temporary switches and counters (removed): HSE 20k-81k
  calls in 300 frames, 0 hidden; records 74 against 132; no trails with
  the clear off (t1's rain does not smear over the black).
- Check in the c1m1 Owens test; break: video_set_clear back to the hook.

## Mission-plan item 14 (2026-10-27): the span target's rect (no change)

- Branch mac4/fade-rect (off mac4/start-settings). Seen in the census's
  quit (Ctrl+Q, Enter, the fade to the lobby): the tint's quad 0,0-640,480,
  alpha 0.99 down. Item 11 confused zrndr_tint's FinishTarget (set by
  zvid::lock_3d) with the fillers' SoftTarget. The fillers read base and
  pitch only; 0x00558070's globals are write-only. Six keys moved to the
  known table (28 now).

## Mission-plan item 12 (2026-10-28): ported but not wired

- Branch mac4/wire-ported (main 1257bca). Each traced (MW3_TRACE_UNPORTED +
  c++filt) and wired in the program's hooks; see mission-plan.md item 12.
  Not straight but done here: the briefing waypoints (five hooks, all
  ported) and video_is_3d (its flag is "opened"; with has_cap unwired it
  would have turned the shadows off).
- Checks: the c1m1 Owens test (none of the nine keys reached, an option
  set mid-mission reaches the mech and back); shots of c1m1, t1, the main
  menu and c1m1's briefing ("Start" shown), all --nosound (stream day).

## Mission-plan item 15 (2026-10-28): the rest traced

- Branch mac4/trace-rest (off mac4/wire-ported d1bf611). Ported
  camera_set_listener 0x004f3430 and display_set_size / _origin 0x004fa580
  / 0x004fa600; wired them, the console's scroll clear, the texture group,
  WiredBuild's view_set_camera (the options' control-mode path reached the
  base) and the load screen's driver and mode lines (Render3D::driver_name,
  new). The launch's camera handle is 0 in engine memory; camera_update
  falls back to program_view()->camera.
- Known now 36 (eight added, reasons in program.md). 0x00537520's
  [0x0072f370] is 0x0057ba80, a Release of the record's system surface.
- Left listed: 0x00526510, 0x005578f0, 0x00557b30, item 17.
- Checks: the Owens test (item 15's keys absent, the listener within 15 of
  the mech); breaks: the WiredBuild override removed, the texture group
  removed, the listener set off: each fails it. All runs --nosound.
- mw3sdltests crashed on its second run in one process once 0x005964c0(0)
  was wired: the first run's nodes stayed on the scroll list (its teardown
  skips the world's unload). Its two runs now reset the list as
  mw3tests' reset_process_state does. Shots of c1m1, t1 and the menu draw.

## Mission-plan item 17 (2026-10-28): the modules' starts

- Branch mac4/module-starts (main bc2c0ab). The 157 writes taken from the
  decomp, every direct read from mech3.asm by containing function, a
  reader counted as run when it has a port (script in the scratchpad;
  the table in docs/module-starts.md).
- No change: the fog differs but the world read sets it all before a draw;
  checked with a temporary print of zmod::fog() at each draw where it
  changed and a switch putting the exe's start values in (removed): one
  identical line per mission (c1m1, t1, c3m1, c4m2). Shots are not
  repeatable run to run (rain, timing), so no byte compare.
- The three known; census 0 unported. Break: a reason without its prefix
  fails known_unported_keys_name_their_reason.

## Mission-plan items 16 and 18 (2026-10-28): the docs, the lab's start

- Branch mac4/docs-16 (main 319826f). ai.md section 6 (the boundary, the
  sensors), damage.md (0x464ce0 is Torso::Steer; the jolt decays in
  0x464e80, ported), movement.md Left (only force feedback left).
- `--lab-mech N` alone: --briefing c1m2 and MECHLAB at 300,435@2500 (the
  route item 9's shots used). The lab's fog checked with the item 17
  print and switch (removed): off, all 0, either start.

## Mission-plan item 19 (2026-10-28): the lance state, three hooks

- Branch mac4/lance-hooks (main 7bbc29a); items 19-23 added to the plan.
- player_lance_state: 0x4cbeb0 calls the game's vt+0x48 (a getter in all
  five game types, read from the exe's vtables) then vt+0x2c, the type;
  4 only for Training (0x473a20). Wired as the launch's type. Test:
  mission_c2m1_lancemate_forms_up_only_in_training_headless, c2m1 run as
  launched (1) and with the type 4: following 262/262 frames, 29.6 m,
  against the formation part 262/262, 0 m. Break: the hook back to -1
  fails 3 checks.
- The three mech hooks: my all-missions list had c1m5, c1m6, c2m5, c2m6
  and c4bm7, which do not exist; the launch found no "player" record (no
  reader archive loaded), made no mech, and the player hooks fell through.
  --mission now refuses a mission without zbd\<op>\readermN.zbd.

## Mission-plan item 20 (2026-10-28): the all-missions census

- Branch mac4/census-all (off item 19, 34b25f7). The test runs 21
  missions (not 20 as I first counted), 1200 frames each, then
  stop_game, exit_instance and destroy (no test called destroy before).
- Its first run found five more keys than the program's runs: the
  program's own exit skips stop_game (item 2), but the Exit state (QUIT)
  runs it. All five are frees; 0x00414000's archive close is the motion
  archive's.
- Game texts: the four slots per game type read from the exe's vtables;
  a debug start answers by its launch (t1 the training lesson).
- Break: game_text back to the logged base fails the census (game.vt in
  t1). The known table is 46 now.

## Mission-plan item 21 (2026-10-28): the census with input

- Branch mac4/census-input (off item 20, 3c7ac04).
- Routes, each through `build/mw3 --verbose --nosound`: walking and
  firing, c1m1 won (--win) through the debriefing, the lab through
  LAUNCH, Instant Action's and Training's pilot screens, options,
  credits, multiplayer, c1m1's pause, Training's lesson 1 launched.
  All end at 0 keys outside the table.
- 15 keys found: 11 wired (the debriefing's voice, the Core state's
  anim stop, the 2D target's size, zClass's flag, zVideo's three device
  queries, training's slot and 0x00433df0, the end's cockpit HUD and its
  objectives box), 4 multiplayer known (deferred). The known table is 50.
- Training's lesson 1 had launched with the slot's default armed loadout;
  now with training1 (equipment only), as the exe. Without it the
  menus' training test never reaches lesson 2.
- The first pause run (`--mission c1m1 --tap 0x01@200`) ran 14 minutes
  and was killed; redone through the menus. (The cause, found in item 22:
  a launched mission's --frames counted only frames with the scene, and the
  pause draws none.)
- Tests: training_menus_to_lesson3_headless checks the loadout and the
  five keys; known_unported_keys_name_their_reason the 50 and the 15.
  Breaks: training's slot unwired fails 6 checks; 0x00586ce0 renamed in
  the table fails 2.

## Mission-plan item 23 (2026-10-28): the list for Owen

- Branch mac4/owen-list (off main 4c2d7cf); docs only, nothing changed.
- `docs/for-owen.md` from playtest.md, fixes.md (Candidates, the table's
  candidate rows, Decided's c4b m4 note) and the topic docs they cite.
- playtest.md's rows #11, #18 and #26 are stale ("waiting", but ported).
  Left for the lead or Owen to close, as the item asked for no changes.
## Mission-plan item 22 (2026-10-28): the 180 s runs

- Branch mac4/long-runs (off main 4c2d7cf).
- The census takes a mission (MW3_CENSUS_MISSION) and prints each
  cycle's numbers (MW3_CENSUS_STATS). A first 360 s run overlapped my
  hang tests, and macOS's resident size fell as pages were compressed
  (79 to 21 MB), so I switched to the footprint (TASK_VM_INFO) and redid
  the runs quietly.
- c4m2: entity.vt+0x28+0xc0 from a field base hit by a turret (team 4,
  unnamed); wired through hud_object_team.
- The live nodes were found by walking the pool's free list. A node has
  no live bit; its link field holds the free chain.
- The hang: not a debug start's end (the free camera's update true quits
  through zgameapp.cpp's post_quit), but a launched mission's frame count
  stopping in the pause. Fixed and tested by the program itself, spawned
  from mw3sdltests (MW3_BIN). Break: the old count is killed at 90 s.
- Open: c4m2's last cycles are 12% slower.

## Resolution step 2 (2026-10-28): the window's shape

- Branch mac4/window-shape (off main a67d090).
- sdl_fit.h (pure geometry), platform::Window::frame_size (from video_open),
  SdlWindow's shape and auto size, the back buffer at the fit rect with the
  black bars in present and in the capture, SdlZinHost and SdlInput through
  the rect.
- VMode can't be set from settings.reg (it is detail.zrd's, never saved),
  so no 16:9 frame reaches the screen before step 3's mode switch. The
  shots for Owen are 640x480 frames: at 1280x720 pillarboxed (c1m1 and the
  main menu) and at 640x480.

## Resolution step 3 (2026-10-28): the mode switch

- Branch mac4/mode-switch (off main 12be988).
- 0x004ab6b0, 0x004ab910 and 0x0041cdc0 are ported on Engine (app_hooks.cpp)
  and checked in test_app_states (three cases, 0x004ab6b0 and 0x0041cdc0
  unstubbed for their own). 0x0040f330 is ported on the real panel and
  checked in test_hud (op 43, with the six globals in the dump).
- The asm's 0x0040f330 call passes ECX the display rect and EDX the render
  rect. My first names for the hook's parameters had them the other way.
- 0x004ab860 always returns 1 (`mov al, 1`), so Shift+V always goes on.
- Program: c1m1 at InGameVMode 13 at 1920x1080, 0 calls outside the table.
  The HUD keeps its 640x480 block (step 4). Its Core state started at frame
  99 here, against 576 in item 22's runs (the fade is timed), so I
  corrected program.md's claim.

## Resolution step 4 (2026-10-28): the HUD by anchors

- Branch mac4/hud-anchors (off main 013378d).
- Anchors read from hud.zrd: every piece moves by w - 640, (w - 640) / 2 or
  h - 480, or not at all. The speed and fuel frames hang from the top.
- The scale: a canvas (the display rect) of the frame over a whole scale,
  so the 16-bit layer and the HUD are drawn small and stretched. The
  render and window rects keep the frame. A first try put the canvas in
  the window rect too, and the 3D projected onto 960x540 inside 1920.
- Two port gaps showed. screen_size set the 3D viewport to the buffer's
  (now canvas) size. The program's HUD hooks answered vmode 0, so the
  set-up never read hud.zrd, at any mode.
- The panels' quads and the views' depth clears are canvas pixels drawn in
  the 3D pass: mapped onto the frame.
- Review (the lead): the waypoint arrow was on the frame's scale. Every
  0x0053cf10 projection is now audited (resolution.md section 8's table).
  Two had no 0x0040da30 in the exe: the arrow, and TARGET through the zoom
  window. Both are mapped. The headless arrow read takes frame 5; the
  pump's 400 passes end before frame 30.

## Resolution step 5 (2026-10-28): the menus

- Branch mac4/menus-any-size (off main f5fc1c3).
- The front end, lab and briefing run at VMode 5 always, so step 2's fit
  covers them. What was left: the pause screen and the quit box over a
  canvas mission. FIX (B) ztwod::dialog_origin centres the 640x480 frame on
  the canvas, read by Dialog's and MenuScreen's constructors.
- The real-click test needs a host whose mouse() is zInput's (the default
  host answers none). Headless buttons have no images, so their rects are
  lines (top == bottom).
- My item 21 bug: render_flush read its rect handle as memory, and the mech
  lab was black from that merge on. Found by bisecting the five merges in
  a scratch worktree (scratchpad, wt-pre). Fixed and tested.

## The blank-screen guard (2026-10-28)

- Branch mac4/screen-guard (off main 8c305fc).
- sdl_program_screens_are_not_blank: 11 program runs at once (21 s), lit
  and green shares from each BMP. The menus' driver now prints each state
  with its frame (--verbose), which is how the shot frames were picked:
  Pilot 44, Action 104, Lab 2504, debriefing's Win 3915.
- Break: the render_flush memory read fails the three lab tabs (lit 0.000).
